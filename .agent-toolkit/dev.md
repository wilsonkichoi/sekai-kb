# sekai-kb dev config

This is the **framework** repo (`github.com/wilsonkichoi/sekai-kb`). The Linear
tracker (team `LB`, project "LB Rebuild") is shared with the first instance; a
packet's `Execution repo:` field says where its code lands (absent → `sekai-kb`
for framework work). Both repos read their own `.agent-toolkit/dev.md`; this one
governs work committed here.

**Which repo a session runs in.** This is the framework-side half of the rule the
first instance's `.agent-toolkit/dev.md` carries; the two must state the same thing.
`gh` resolves against the working-directory repository, so the working directory is
what makes cross-repo targeting correct — not a per-call `-R` flag. **A session runs
in the repository that owns the documents it reads and the commits it makes**, which
are always the same repository:

- **Execution skills** — `/dev:execute`, `/dev:review-pr`, `/dev:verify` — run in the
  repository named by the packet's `Execution repo:` field. Framework work (Phase 6+,
  anything touching `src/`, `scripts/`, `.agents/skills/`, or the maintainer docs) runs
  here, so PR numbers, CI runs, and review threads resolve against this repository with
  no flag and no bare-`#N` ambiguity. A packet about an instance's own content, config,
  feature flags, or `/sekai-upgrade` adoption names that instance and runs there.
- **`/dev:plan`** runs in the repository whose ROADMAP carries the phase being
  decomposed, and amends that ROADMAP there. Phases 6-11 are framework phases: plan them
  here against `docs/ROADMAP.md`. A constraint that lands on the other repository is
  recorded in the packet and surfaced to the maintainer, never written into the other
  repository's ROADMAP from this side.
- **`/dev:backlog`** runs where the change lands. A stub that becomes framework work is
  triaged here against `docs/SPEC.md` + `docs/ROADMAP.md`; a stub about an instance's
  content, config, or adoption is triaged there. The Linear stub itself is repo-neutral —
  triage picks the side, and the resulting packet's `Execution repo:` field records it.
- **`/dev:status` and `/dev:retro`** read the tracker, which spans both repositories, so
  either working directory answers correctly. Run `/dev:retro` in the repository whose
  rules it may promote into: a lesson about framework code belongs in this tree's
  `.agent-toolkit/rules/`, one about an instance's process belongs in that instance's.
  A retro producing both writes each rule on its own side.
- Every packet states `Execution repo:` — that field is what makes this mechanical.
  Record the full PR URL on the Linear task either way: the tracker spans both
  repositories and PR numbering does not.

Where the two copies disagree, this one governs framework commits and the instance's
governs its own — and the disagreement is a defect to report, not a choice to make.

## Binding docs

- **Product SSOT:** `docs/PRD.md` — what the framework is for, who adopts it, north
  star, non-goals.
- **Engineering SSOT:** `docs/SPEC.md` + `docs/adr/` — architecture, contracts, risk
  controls, negative requirements, and accepted decisions.
- **Delivery SSOT:** `docs/ROADMAP.md` — phases 6-11 task blocks, amendments, ordering
  rules, and exit gates. `/dev:plan` converts packets from those blocks and amends this
  file, not a sibling checkout.
- These four paths are **framework maintainer docs**: the init wizard strips them from
  adopter clones and `npm run framework-docs` gates the contract (ADR 008). Phases 0-5,
  the extraction map, the inherited-fork disposition, and ADRs 001-002 stay in instance
  #1's repository as its rebuild history. A conflict among these documents goes to the
  maintainer, never silently resolved.
- **Iron rules + where things live:** `AGENTS.md` (agent-instruction SSOT,
  genericity + English-only, framework vs instance). `CLAUDE.md` is the one-line
  `@AGENTS.md` shim.
- **Release discipline (read before cutting a release):** `CHANGELOG.md` preamble —
  every change lands with a CHANGELOG entry, breaking config changes carry an
  **Upgrade note**, instances merge tags only, instance-owned files
  (`.gitattributes merge=ours`) are never overwritten. `CHANGELOG.md` is the framework
  release log in this repo but becomes instance-owned when the init wizard replaces it.
- **Upgrade mechanics:** `docs/runbook/UPGRADE.md` + the `/sekai-upgrade` skill; ADR 004
  (tagged-release topology).

## Conventions

- **Genericity is machine-gated whole-tree in template mode.** The `.sekai-template`
  marker makes `npm run genericity` scan the entire repo (not just code trees), so
  `.agent-toolkit/` content is scanned too — keep dev config and rules free of
  place-name denylist terms and CJK codepoints.
- **Release = CHANGELOG entry → bump `FRAMEWORK-VERSION` → tag
  `sekai-kb-vX.Y.Z` → push the tag.** Tags are immutable and never re-pointed
  (CHANGELOG release rules). The tag suffix must equal the file's v-prefixed value.
  `package.json` is a private Node manifest, not a framework release SSOT. Tagging is
  a `dev:verify`-time step, after merge.
- **Framework-upgrade PRs in instances merge with a real merge commit, never
  squash** — the mechanics (Merge-instructions block in the PR body, post-merge
  `git merge-base --is-ancestor` ancestry assertion) live in the instance-side rule
  `upgrade-prs-merge-commit-never-squash.md`, carried in each instance's own
  `rules_dir`, not shipped in this framework repo. Framework-repo feature PRs use
  `merge_policy: squash` unless their branch history is itself the deliverable.
- **Dev-plugin state is instance-owned and adopter-stripped.** `.agent-toolkit/**`
  and `AGENTS.md` carry `merge=ours`; the init wizard strips `.agent-toolkit/` and
  the `AGENTS.md` reference line from adopter clones (ADR 006). Rules here are
  lessons from developing the framework's `src/`/`scripts/`; adopters never touch
  those trees, so they never ship. `merge=ours` protects content, not absence: an
  adopter's stripped state is preserved by `scripts/upgrade/dev-plugin-state.mjs`,
  which `/sekai-upgrade` runs before and after every tag merge (ADR 006 addendum). A
  change to this tree's shape must keep that helper's `stripped`/`installed`
  definitions true — `scripts/upgrade/check-upgrade-state.sh` is the gate.
- **Framework and instance changelogs are separate.** Releases update this repo's
  `CHANGELOG.md`. `npm run init` writes an instance-only changelog at the same path and
  `merge=ours` preserves it. `/sekai-upgrade` reads framework notes from the target tag with
  `git show <tag>:CHANGELOG.md`; it never copies the framework log over the instance log.
  `FRAMEWORK-VERSION` is also instance-owned: the merge preserves it, then `/sekai-upgrade`
  bumps it explicitly after verification.
- **Version domains never overlap.** `VERSION` is the adopter's release SSOT and
  carries `merge=ours`; `FRAMEWORK-VERSION` is the adopted Sekai release SSOT.
  Neither value is stored in `package.json`.

## Rules

Promoted engineering lessons (`dev:retro`) in `rules_dir`, one file per rule.
Project bootstrap **discovers** rules by walking `rules_dir` and reading each
file's `tier` frontmatter — it does not `@`-import a registry list, so nothing
below is a bare `@path` line (a leftover `@` import would make a harness inline
every gotcha each session, defeating the triggers). Every Markdown file under
`rules_dir` must declare a valid `tier`; an unclassified file fails the bootstrap
closed rather than being silently dropped. See the dev plugin's
`runtime_contracts/project-bootstrap.md` for the loading contract and trigger
matching.

- **`tier: doctrine`** — always selected by project bootstrap; standing judgment
  inlined into every session.
- **`tier: gotcha`** — selected only when a `triggers:` entry matches the task: a
  `paths` glob against the changed files, or an `objective` / `definition_of_done`
  case-insensitive substring. A gotcha needs at least one trigger.
- **`tier: none`** — a non-rule Markdown file that stays in place, loaded by nothing.

CI gates complete classification with the dev plugin's own checker
(`resolve_project_rules.py --check`), run through the upstream composite action
declared by `dev_plugin_repository` and `dev_plugin_release` in this file's
frontmatter. This repository vendors no second copy of that checker. The
`npm run dev-plugin:check` gate fails if a `check-rules` workflow reference drifts
from that declaration. `--check` is stricter than a lifecycle run in one place: a
bare `@path` line under `## Rules` is an error here, where a lifecycle run only
warns.

The step lives in the `test` job of `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which runs on
every pull request and every push to `main`. What enforces it is the job graph:
`build` needs `test` and `deploy` needs `build`, so a red `test` blocks the Pages
deploy no matter how branch protection is configured. (Checked 2026-07-25: `main`
carried no branch protection, so no job was a GitHub *required status check*
either. That is a repository setting, changeable without a commit here, which is
why the job graph is what this paragraph relies on.)

The action detects `.agent-toolkit/dev.md` itself and skips with exit 0 when it is
absent, so an adopter stripped by `npm run init` needs no shell guard on the gate;
the `init-check` job proves that against a tree the wizard really stripped. The
non-vacuity fixture in `test` — which proves the wiring still fails an unclassified
rule file — *is* guarded on that file, because a stripped adopter has no rules for
it to prove anything about.

Doctrine rules are not indexed below: the resolver inlines every one of them into
each dev session, so a summary line would restate content already in context. The
gotcha table is indexed, because gotchas load only on a trigger match. Either way
the resolver's source of truth is each file's own frontmatter, never this list.

### Gotchas

- `.agent-toolkit/rules/astro-geojson-import-raw.md` — build-time import of a `.geojson` (or other non-JSON data extension): use `?raw` + `JSON.parse`; Vite has no loader for the bare extension.
- `.agent-toolkit/rules/astro-json-island-escape.md` — emitting build-time JSON into a `set:html` `<script type="application/json">` island: escape every `<` to its `\u003c` form (`JSON.stringify` does not), or a `</script>` inside a string value breaks out of the island.
- `.agent-toolkit/rules/astro-static-paths-scope.md` — `getStaticPaths` helpers must be inlined or exported; non-exported frontmatter helpers are tree-shaken from the prerender chunk and throw at build.
- `.agent-toolkit/rules/external-link-arrow-exclusion.md` — adding a `target="_blank"` link inside an article surface: give it `class="no-external-icon"` or global CSS appends a stray ↗.
- `.agent-toolkit/rules/github-actions-least-privilege.md` — a workflow that runs PR code sets `permissions: contents: read` top-level; grant write scopes only on the job that needs them.
- `.agent-toolkit/rules/gray-matter-date-normalization.md` — normalize `matter().data.date` to an ISO string immediately; gray-matter silently coerces unquoted YAML dates to `Date`, breaking sort/`slice`.
- `.agent-toolkit/rules/lockfile-cross-platform.md` — after a dependency change verify `rm -rf node_modules && npm ci`; fully regenerate the lockfile when a package has platform-conditional native bindings.
- `.agent-toolkit/rules/optional-build-time-json-readfilesync.md` — an optional (maybe-absent) build-time JSON file: read it with `readFileSync` + `try/catch`, never `await import()` (Rollup fails to resolve before the catch runs).
- `.agent-toolkit/rules/prebuild-parallel-no-sibling-rm.md` — a `run-p` prebuild script cleans only its own output subtree, never a shared parent dir a sibling writes into concurrently.
- `.agent-toolkit/rules/prebuild-scripts-compute-not-fabricate.md` — prebuild scripts have full fs/git access: compute values from real repo data; hardcoding constants (with a "no access" comment) is fabricated data and a review blocker.
- `.agent-toolkit/rules/remark-plugin-no-dynamic-import.md` — remark/rehype plugins can't dynamically `import()` project config inside Vite's module runner; pass project data as plugin options from `astro.config.ts`.
- `.agent-toolkit/rules/shell-script-portability.md` — `scripts/**` must run on macOS bash 3.2 and CI bash 5: no `mapfile`/`readarray`, `unset CDPATH` before `cd`-in-`$()`.
