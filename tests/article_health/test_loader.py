"""Tests for article_health.loader.

Critical invariants:

- A markdown link URL's closing `)` must sit inside a protected region so
  punctuation rules never rewrite it.
- A malformed link (missing/wrong close paren) must NOT let the link-url
  protected region span across newlines and swallow a later line's real `)`.
- Frontmatter is separated from body.
- is_article_path is the tool's target contract (knowledge/{Category}/*.md,
  no leading-underscore hubs).
