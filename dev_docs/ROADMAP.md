# ROADMAP: Sekai KB

**Framework maintainer document.** This is the delivery-plan SSOT for the framework's
feature phases. Milestones are tracker project milestones, one per phase. Task packets
are converted from this document's detailed blocks by `/dev:plan`, never re-derived;
their Steps/Acceptance text governs packet detail.
Every phase transition is a maintainer gate: `/dev:plan` for the next scheduled phase runs
only after the maintainer confirms the current scheduled phase closed. Estimates use
`AI implement+review | Human`.

> **Stripped at adoption.** `npm run init` removes this file along with `dev_docs/PRD.md`,
> `dev_docs/SPEC.md`, and `dev_docs/adr/`. It plans the framework's own development, not an
> adopted instance's work (ADR 008).

**Scope of this document (2026-07-28, ADR 008).** Phases 0-5 built the first instance and
cut the framework out of it. That history — the extraction map, the inherited-fork
disposition, the per-task packet-shaping notes, and the phase-0-through-5 table — is
instance #1's rebuild record and stays in its repository. What moved here are the phases
whose code executes in `sekai-kb`: **6 through 12**, plus the amendments and ordering
rules that govern them. The tracker remains a single project spanning both repositories,
so task ids (`LB-*`) are continuous across the split.

| # | Milestone | Outcome | Scope (tasks) | Exit gate | Est |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6 | Social + engagement | Feedback (Worker + D1 + widget + triage), snippet pipeline, soundscape | 6.1a-c · 6.2 · 6.3 · 6.3b · 6.3c · 6.3d · 6.4 | Live submission → D1 → GitHub issue, and three real recordings; tag released; instance #1 adopts clean (6.4); maintainer phase confirm | AI 20.25h \| Human 3h |
| 7 | Differentiators | On-demand OG worker, RAG chat (bge-m3 + Workers AI, free tier end to end), QR flow | 7.1 · 7.2a-c · 7.3 · 7.4 | Eval set answered with citations, no hallucinated places (7.2c); tag released; instance #1 adopts clean (7.4); maintainer phase confirm | AI 14.5h \| Human 2.5h |
| 8 | Semiont plugin layer | **DEFERRED — unscheduled (2026-08-12 amendment, D1).** Organ architecture in sekai-kb (config.json manifest, core organs); instance #1 enables core + MANIFESTO | 8.1 · 8.2 · 8.3 | Site builds with `semiont/` deleted and organs toggle via config only; tag released; instance #1 adopts clean (8.3); maintainer phase confirm | AI 5h \| Human 0.5h |
| 9 | MCP + AI delivery | Remote MCP server (`workers/mcp/`) exposing list_topics/get_article/search/semantic_search; AI-access page + `/kb/agent.md` boot file; adopter upgrade playbook; CI corpus refresh so retrieval never goes stale | 9.1 · 9.2 · 9.3 · 9.4 · 9.5 | An MCP client connected to the instance's `/mcp` endpoint answers a question about its place via tools, no clone; tag released; instance #1 adopts clean (9.5); maintainer phase confirm | AI 9h \| Human 1h |
| 10 | Perception (analytics) | GA4 + Search Console + Cloudflare Web Analytics live behind `features.analytics`; signal fetchers ported; dashboard analytics panels | 10.1 · 10.2a · 10.2b · 10.3 | Dashboard renders real traffic/search data from a fetch run, zero analytics IDs in `src/` outside place.config; tag released; instance #1 adopts clean (10.3); maintainer phase confirm | AI 9.25h \| Human 1.75h |
| 11 | Operational automation | **NEXT: independent of Phase 8 (2026-08-18 amendment; ADR 013).** Native Claude Code cloud Routines + GitHub Actions contract and runbook; content PR review; link/health audit; scheduled analytics rebuild; trend discovery; rewrite maintenance | 11.1 · 11.3 · 11.5 · 11.6 · 11.8 · 11.9 | Two routines live >= 1 week, every repository change through a PR and zero direct pushes to main; scheduled analytics refresh proven; tag released; instance #1 adopts clean (11.9); maintainer phase confirm | AI 12.5h \| Human 1.25h |
| 12 | Gated integrations | **DEFERRED: unscheduled until its own gates are satisfied; no Phase 8 dependency (2026-08-18 amendment; ADR 013).** Human-approved feedback triage and real-account social publishing | 12.1 · 12.2 · 12.3 | One feedback plan approved and applied through its routine run; one approved snippet posted exactly once through a live adapter; tag released; instance #1 adopts clean (12.3); maintainer phase confirm | AI 7.5h \| Human 1.25h |

**Exit-gate shape (uniform for phases 6-12).** Every `Exit gate` cell above states the same
four things in the same order, and a phase is not closed until all four hold:

1. **The feature proof** — the phase-specific demonstration, run against something real.
2. **The tag** — `sekai-kb-vX.Y.Z` released, with a CHANGELOG entry and an **Upgrade note**
   for any config-schema addition.
3. **Instance #1 adopts it clean** — the adoption sequence in that repository's ROADMAP
   §"Phases 6-11": `/sekai-upgrade` against the tag, merged with a real merge commit and
   never a squash, instance-owned files untouched, the instance's own CI green on the
   merged tree, and `FRAMEWORK-VERSION` bumped only after that verification. Tracked as the
   phase's terminal packet, named in the cell.
4. **Maintainer phase confirm**: the gate `/dev:plan` for the next scheduled phase waits on.

Part 3 is why every phase has a terminal packet (6.4, 7.4, 8.3, 9.5, 10.3, 11.9, 12.3): adoption
is real work with human steps, so it is tracked as a task rather than asserted as a
property. Those packets execute in the instance repository; the tag they adopt is cut in
`sekai-kb` at verify of the phase's last framework task.

**Totals for these phases:** the active scope is phases 6, 7, 9, 10, and 11:
**AI ≈ 65.5h | Human ≈ 9.5h** (6: 20.25/3, 7: 14.5/2.5, 9: 9/1, 10: 9.25/1.75,
11: 12.5/1.25). Phases 8 and 12 are deferred and unscheduled, carrying **AI ≈ 12.5h |
Human ≈ 1.75h** they will cost whenever their independent gates are satisfied (8: 5/0.5,
12: 7.5/1.25). Everything sums to **AI ≈ 78h | Human ≈ 11.25h** across all seven phases.
Phase 6's numbers are the 2026-07-29 planning amendment's as revised by the three later
Phase 6 amendments, not the original block estimates; phases 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12 have
terminal adoption packets; Phase 7's are the 2026-08-05 planning amendment's; Phase 9's
are the 2026-08-12 amendment's; phases 11 and 12 are the 2026-08-18 re-range amendment's.
**Every figure in this paragraph is summed from the per-phase subtotals below.** Phases 0-5,
and therefore the grand totals for the whole programme, are recorded in instance #1's
roadmap.

**Language policy:** every phase ships English-only. The framework carries no
CJK/multi-language code path, language profile, or gate — in ANY code tree (`src/`,
`scripts/`, `tests/`, `workers/`, `.agents/skills/`), test fixtures included, never just
the directory a DoD happens to name. Language support is a post-project revisit after
Phase 12 (PRD non-goals). `/dev:plan` must not emit packets that retain CJK code for
hypothetical adopters. Enforcement is machine: the genericity gate scans all code trees
and CI includes a CJK-codepoint scan.
**Adopter-facing boundary:** the adopter docs (README, the wizard-emitted `AGENTS.md`,
the playbook) state the support boundary explicitly rather than coding around it — UI
strings and editorial tooling are English-calibrated; Latin-script content largely works
(plain word tokenization; article-health prose thresholds may need retuning per
instance); CJK content is unsupported until the post-project multi-language revisit. The
schema seams (`place.locale`, `place.languages[]`) stay declared but dormant.

**Ordering rules (structural, not preference):** Phases 6 and 7 depend on the framework
cut — the framework ships before instance fun-features (ADR 002, held in instance #1's
history; SPEC `Risk controls`). Phase 9 depends on 7.2c (the inherited-fork
disposition's named MCP trigger). Phase 11 depends on capabilities delivered in phases 6,
7, 9, and 10, but not on Phase 8. Phase 12 depends on 11.1 plus its own human-approval and
real-account gates, but not on Phase 8. Reordering is a scope change requiring the
maintainer's explicit call.

**Execution order as of 2026-08-18: 6 → 7 → 9 → 10 → 11.** Phase 8 remains deferred and
unscheduled. Phase 12 is separately deferred until its feedback-approval and social-account
gates are satisfied. ADR 013 removes the old 8 → 11 dependency rather than routing around
it: native Claude Code cloud Routines and GitHub Actions own operational scheduling, while
Semiont remains an optional identity and memory layer.

**Execution repo flow (post-cut ownership rule, ADR 004/005):** every
code task in these phases executes in the `sekai-kb` repository; each phase closes with a
tagged sekai-kb release (CHANGELOG entry + upgrade note for any config-schema addition),
and instance #1 adopts it via `/sekai-upgrade` — that pull is part 3 of each phase's exit
gate above, tracked as the phase's terminal packet (6.4, 7.4, 8.3, 9.5, 10.3, 11.9, 12.3). The
only instance-side commits are instance-owned: feature flags in `place.config.ts`,
analytics IDs, native routine registration, and wrangler secrets. New `place.config` keys must be
absent-safe (missing key = feature off) so existing adopter instances upgrade without
config surgery.

The instance side of every one of those packets is the same four-step sequence, defined
once in instance #1's ROADMAP under "Phases 6-11" along with a per-phase table of the flags
it flips and the inputs only it has. The packets here reference that sequence rather than
restating it; Phase 12 reuses the same sequence and adds its two gated integrations. The
two documents cannot drift into disagreement about what "adopts it clean" means.

## Agent-toolkit migration amendment — approved 2026-07-19

Records the future-phase deltas from the dev-plugin 0.0.55 migration (ADR 006 +
addendum): `AGENTS.md` is the agent-instruction SSOT and adopter/instance-owned
(`merge=ours`); `CLAUDE.md` is a byte-exact one-line `@AGENTS.md` shim, never
content-bearing; all rules are dev-plugin state in `.agent-toolkit/rules/` and the
template ships none. These rulings govern packet conversion for the
affected phases. **Phases 6-7 and 10-11 need no changes** — their blocks touch none of
the migrated surfaces.

- **8.1 organ-loader ruling (supersedes task 8.1 step 2's "CLAUDE.md boot section" and
  ADR 003's original loader location):** the loader is a stable one-paragraph boot hook
  seeded into the starter `AGENTS.md` by the init wizard — read `semiont/config.json`,
  load enabled organs' boot files, no-op gracefully when the config is absent. All
  evolving loader logic and organ substance live in framework-owned `semiont/` files, so
  the adopter-owned hook rarely changes; when it must, the change reaches existing
  instances via `/sekai-upgrade`'s conversational starter-diff step, never a silent merge
  (same pattern as the dev-plugin reference line in `AGENTS.md`). Boot-time organ
  loading — MEMORY/REFLEXES inlined each session, ADR 003's core-organ intent — is
  preserved. The `/dev:plan` packet for 8.1 cites this ruling, not the superseded wording.
- **8.2 naming:** the acceptance's "become skill boots" reads as the 8.1 boot hook (the
  inherited `become` skill was re-dispositioned into 8.1 by the 2026-07-11 ruling).
- **9.3 corrections (applied inline in the extension block below):**
  `docs/runbook/UPGRADE.md` already exists (written in Phase 5), so 9.3
  extends and proves it rather than writing it; and the absent-safe schema rule lands
  in sekai-kb's `AGENTS.md` + playbook, not "the framework CLAUDE.md".

---

## Phase 6 planning amendment — approved 2026-07-29

Records the `/dev:plan` conversion decisions for Phase 6. The blocks below carry them
inline; this section is the rationale, and the packet bodies cite it.

- **6.1b splits into 6.1b + 6.1c.** The original block bundled the widget (frontend plus a
  `place.config` schema addition) with the triage skill (`wrangler` + `gh` ops tooling behind
  a human-approval loop). Different surfaces, different failure modes, independently
  verifiable, and keeping them together chained the widget behind the triage skill's manual
  criterion. Both still depend only on 6.1a, so they run in parallel.
- **Skill names take the `sekai-` prefix.** The block's `/snippet` and "a triage skill" become
  `/sekai-snippet` and `/sekai-triage-feedback` (`AGENTS.md` §Skill discovery and ownership:
  the namespace prevents collisions with adopter and tool-provided skills).
- **6.4 is a new packet, not an untracked gate.** The milestone's exit gate is real work with
  human steps, and Phase 5 tracked its closer the same way. It is the only Phase 6 packet
  whose `Execution repo:` is the instance.
- **6.3's "first three recordings" splits by repository (decision D1).** The template is a
  fictional place and cannot own field recordings, so the framework ships three synthesized
  demo clips that make the player and the visual bar provable, credited as synthesized rather
  than field-recorded, and stripped by the wizard at adoption. The three real recordings are
  6.4's instance-side work, which is where the block's Human 2h actually falls.
- **`workers/` joins the place-name gate's instance-mode scan roots in 6.1a (decision D2).**
  `.agent-toolkit/rules/genericity-gate-scope.md` recorded the gap as a deferral "for when
  that tree arrives"; 6.1a is the task that makes it arrive. Whole-tree template mode hides
  the hole in this repository, so shipping `workers/` without closing it would leave adopted
  instances with an unguarded place-identity ingress in framework-owned code. The change is
  one `SCAN_ROOTS` line plus the 13 statements `scripts/ci/check-scan-root-docs.mjs`
  registers for that gate, which fails CI on any site missed.
- **6.2 ships the runner and a manual sink, still zero platform adapters (decision D3).** The
  queue format documents `status: posted`; with an interface alone nothing can ever set it,
  so the lifecycle contract would ship with an unreachable state and 11.7 would inherit both
  the runner and the first adapter. The shipped sink is not a platform client: it prints the
  post text for the operator to paste and records the resulting URL, which is what happens
  before any account automation exists. `dev_docs/PRD.md`'s "no framework features for
  hypothetical adopters" is satisfied — no platform API client is built.
- **Estimates:** Phase 6 becomes AI ≈ 11.75h | Human ≈ 3h (was AI 9.5h | Human 2.5h), from
  the split, 6.4, D2, and D3.

---

## Phase 6 planning amendment — approved 2026-07-31

Records the one block added after 6.3 shipped. Same form as the 2026-07-29 amendment: the
block below carries the decision inline, this section is the rationale.

- **6.3b is a new block, inserted between 6.3 and 6.4.** 6.3 shipped `/soundscape` as a flat
  single-column list. The reference implementation of this page on the first instance's live
  site carries ordered categories, a card grid, per-category wishlists of sounds still wanted,
  and a contribute block; that shape is what makes the page a collection rather than a file
  listing. `dev_docs/PRD.md`'s "no framework features for hypothetical adopters" is satisfied by
  the same test 6.2's decision D3 used: a real instance runs this page shape in production, so
  the need is demonstrated rather than speculative.
- **It blocks 6.4 rather than following it.** 6.4 step 3 commits the instance's three real
  recordings as manifest entries against the tag cut in step 1. Landing the schema change
  after that tag would write those entries in the flat shape and rewrite them into categories
  on the next tag, and would confirm the phase exit gate's visual bar against a layout already
  scheduled to change. Ordering it before 6.4 costs the block's estimate and buys one write.
- **The manifest stays the single source.** Categories, wishlist entries, and the richer
  per-recording fields are declared in `knowledge/sounds/_manifest.md`, never in a data module
  under `src/` — the place-name and English-only gates scan that tree, and the reference
  instance's equivalent file could not exist here. A flat `sounds:` list keeps rendering, so
  an adopter's existing manifest is not broken by the release.
- **Estimates:** Phase 6 becomes AI ≈ 16h | Human ≈ 3h (was AI ≈ 11.75h | Human ≈ 3h), from
  6.3b alone.

---

## Phase 6 planning amendment — approved 2026-08-03

Records the one block added after 6.3b shipped. Same form as the 2026-07-31 amendment: the
block below carries the decision inline, this section is the rationale.

- **6.3c is a new block, inserted between 6.3b and 6.4.** 6.3 shipped the soundscape reader
  (`src/lib/sounds.ts`) and 6.3b shipped the categorized layout, but neither shipped a writer
  or a validation gate. Every other Phase 6 content surface has both: 6.2 ships
  `scripts/tools/snippet/publish.mjs` plus `npm run test:snippet` in CI, the feedback worker
  carries its own D1 schema and test suite, and the manifest itself is the one surface with no
  check at all — a typo'd `file`, a missing mp3, or a missing required field is silently
  dropped and CI says nothing. The writer (`npm run sounds:add`) and gate (`npm run
  sounds:check`) close that asymmetry.
- **It blocks 6.4 rather than following it.** 6.4 DoD 6 requires committing the instance's
  three real recordings through `npm run sounds:add`. Hand-writing the entries and shipping the
  tool later writes them twice and validates the exit gate against a path the framework does
  not support. Ordering the tool before 6.4 costs this block's estimate and buys one write
  — the same tradeoff the 2026-07-31 amendment made for 6.3b.
- **Estimates:** Phase 6 becomes AI ≈ 18.5h | Human ≈ 3h (was AI ≈ 16h | Human ≈ 3h), from
  6.3c alone.

---

## Phase 6 planning amendment — approved 2026-08-03

Records the one block added after 6.3c shipped. Same form as the amendment above: the block
carries the decision inline, this section is the rationale.

- **6.3d is a new block, inserted between 6.3c and 6.4.** 6.3c shipped the ingest writer and
  the manifest validation gate, but the writer published the recording verbatim. Consumer
  phones write capture coordinates, capture timestamp, device make and model, and OS version
  into the container; ffmpeg copies input metadata to its output by default and Astro copies
  `public/` into `dist/` byte-for-byte, so nothing between the recording and the published
  asset removed any of it. Found by `/dev:review-pr` on the instance's exit-gate PR, where
  three of the four committed recordings carried GPS to roughly ten metres. This is a
  framework defect: every adopter running `sounds:add` publishes the same data, and one
  recording near home publishes their home coordinates.
- **The writer fix alone does not close it.** Hand-placing a file into
  `public/media/sounds/` and hand-writing the manifest entry is a documented, supported path,
  so `sounds:check` gains the matching gate. Same asymmetry 6.3c closed for the manifest,
  applied to the published bytes.
- **It blocks 6.4 rather than following it.** 6.4 DoD 6 commits the instance's real
  recordings through `npm run sounds:add`. Shipping the exit gate before the strip publishes
  the coordinates first and scrubs them second, which is not a state a public site should
  pass through. Ordering the fix before 6.4 costs this block's estimate; 6.4 then adopts the
  tag and re-ingests or scrubs the four already-committed assets.
- **Estimates:** Phase 6 becomes AI ≈ 20.25h | Human ≈ 3h (was AI ≈ 18.5h | Human ≈ 3h),
  from 6.3d alone.

---

## Exit-gate amendment — approved 2026-08-04

Makes the adoption half of every phase gate explicit and uniform. Nothing about phase scope
or ordering changes; what changes is that a rule already stated in prose is now stated in
each phase's own `Exit gate` cell and tracked by a packet.

**What was wrong.** The `Execution repo flow` paragraph has always said that each phase
closes with a tagged release which instance #1 adopts, and that the pull is part of the exit
gate. The milestone table only carried that clause for phases 9, 10, and 11. Phase 6
deferred it to packet 6.4; phases 7 and 8 stated neither. Only 6.4 and 9.3 existed as
terminal packets, so for phases 7, 8, 10, and 11 the adoption step was work nobody had
estimated and no task tracked — the shape that lets a phase be declared closed while the
instance is still on the previous release.

**The rulings:**

- **Every phase 6-11 `Exit gate` cell states the same four parts in the same order** —
  feature proof, tag released, instance #1 adopts clean, maintainer confirm. The shape is
  written out once under the milestone table.
- **Every phase gets a terminal adoption packet:** 6.4 and 9.3 already existed; **7.4, 8.3,
  10.3, and 11.9 are new.** Each is modelled on 6.4, including its `Execution repo:` line —
  the packet's commits land in the instance, and the tag it adopts is cut in `sekai-kb` at
  verify of that phase's last framework task.
- **The instance side is referenced, never restated.** The four-step adoption sequence and
  the per-phase table of flags and instance-only inputs live in instance #1's ROADMAP under
  "Phases 6-11". These packets cite it. Two documents restating one sequence is exactly the
  drift `check-scan-root-docs.mjs` exists to prevent elsewhere.
- **`/dev:plan` converts the new packets like any other block.** They are ordinary tasks
  with human steps, not a ceremony appended after a phase closes.
- **Estimates:** the four new packets add AI ≈ 3.25h | Human ≈ 3h across phases 7, 8, 10,
  and 11. Totals above are updated; no existing block's estimate changed.

**Enforcement.** `npm run roadmap-gates` (`scripts/ci/check-roadmap-exit-gates.mjs`) fails
CI when a milestone row's exit gate omits the adoption clause or names a packet that no task
block defines. Prose has not held this rule — it was unenforced in four of six rows since it
was written — and the standing doctrine when a rule keeps being missed is to add a check
rather than another paragraph (`dev_docs/research/origin-decisions.md §3`).

---

## Phase 7 planning amendment — approved 2026-08-05

Records the `/dev:plan` conversion decisions for Phase 7. The Phase 7 blocks below carry
them inline; this section is the rationale, and the packet bodies cite it. Same form as the
four Phase 6 amendments.

- **D1 — chat generation is Workers AI free tier, not the Claude API.** The maintainer's
  ruling: an adopter brings their own Cloudflare account and nothing else, exactly as the
  feedback worker already requires, so **both** the embedding call and the generation call
  run on the Workers AI free tier. This supersedes block 7.2b step 1 ("pass top-k chunks to
  Claude"), the Human lines on 7.2b and 7.4 that budgeted for a Claude API key, and the
  milestone row's "Claude API". It also contradicts two statements in `dev_docs/SPEC.md` —
  §Stack's "**Chat generation calls the Claude API**" bullet and §New builds (6)'s "calls
  Claude with citation-required prompting" — and those edits land **in the 7.2b packet**,
  where the code proves them, rather than in a separate architecture pass. What survives the
  change is the discipline attached to the superseded bullet: the model is **not pinned in
  the SPEC**, it is chosen against the current Workers AI catalog at execution time, and
  `dev_docs/research/platform-notes.md §2.10` remains the documented quality/cost escalation
  to a hosted model. The gain is that the framework then ships with no third-party API key
  at all, which is the strongest available form of `dev_docs/PRD.md`'s no-paid-services
  non-goal; the cost is answer quality against a free 8B-class model, which the 7.2c
  evaluation set is what measures.
- **D2 — corpus embedding ships one provider, Workers AI REST.** SPEC §Stack permits
  "offline GPU or Workers AI" for the corpus; only the second is built. The port source is
  Ollama-based and its provider layer is dropped with the rest of its article-level and
  multi-language code. Removes 7.2a's Human 0.5h, which existed only for the GPU path.
- **D3 — the vectors artifact is derived and gitignored, with a tracked-file gate.**
  Block 7.2a says to emit the vectors into `workers/chat/`, which is correct, but the file
  carries article titles, URLs, and body text into a tree that may carry no place identity
  (`AGENTS.md` iron rule 2, and both machine gates scan `workers/`). It therefore takes the
  `wrangler.generated.toml` treatment exactly: `.gitignore`, the skip lists in both gates,
  and a `check-worker-config.mjs` failure if git tracks it.
- **D4 — the evaluation set lives in `knowledge/chat/_eval.md`,** not `workers/chat/eval/`
  as block 7.2c says. Same reason as D3: the questions are about the place. The leading `_`
  is what makes the three `knowledge/` scanners skip it, as with the soundscape manifest.
- **D5 — QR contexts live in `knowledge/chat/_contexts.md` and the printable sheet is
  `npm run qr:sheet`,** not a public route. Greetings are place content, and keeping the
  sheet a script means Phase 7 adds exactly one page (`/chat`) to the gated route list.
- **D6 — new `place.config` keys, all absent-safe:** `features.og?`, `workers.og?`,
  `workers.chat?`, plus `workers.chatDatabaseId?` only if 7.2b's rate limit falls back to
  D1 rather than the Workers rate-limiting binding. Missing key = capability off, per the
  spec invariant.
- **Port source:** the v1 `build-embeddings.mjs` the maintainer supplied at plan time is
  recorded in the 7.2a packet, not here — its path names the pre-cut instance, and the
  place-name gate scans this file in template mode.
- **Estimates:** Phase 7 becomes AI ≈ 14.5h | Human ≈ 2.5h (was AI ≈ 13.25h | Human ≈
  3.25h). AI gains 0.5h on 7.2a (the gitignore + two-gate + tracked-file wiring of D3) and
  0.5h on 7.2b (the rate limit and CORS the block did not name, which the feedback worker
  established as the house minimum for a public endpoint); Human loses 0.5h on 7.2a (D2)
  and 0.25h on 7.4 (no Claude API key to provision). The 13.25h it replaces was itself
  0.25h under the block sum.

## Phase 8/11 deferral and Phase 9 planning amendment — approved 2026-08-12

Two things at once, because they are one decision: the maintainer deferred phases 8 and 11,
and that made Phase 9 the next phase, so its blocks were converted in the same session. Same
form as the six amendments above — the blocks carry the decisions inline, this section is the
rationale, and the packets cite it. ADR 011 records the architecture half.

- **D1 — phases 8 and 11 are deferred indefinitely; the active roadmap ends at Phase 10.**
  Not dropped and not re-scoped: ADR 003 (organ layer) and ADR 005 (routines) stand as
  accepted architecture with no delivery date, their blocks below are untouched, and their
  milestone rows keep their exit gates. What unblocks them is a maintainer call to schedule
  8; 11 follows it. `AGENTS.md` §Semiont probe already says `semiont/config.json` is absent
  in this release and that nothing may require it — deferral makes that sentence true for
  longer and needs no edit anywhere in the code trees, which is the property ADR 003's
  opt-in design was bought for.
- **D2 — 11.2 is pulled forward into Phase 9 as 9.4.** Its stated dependencies are 7.2a and
  9.1, never 8.1, so nothing about it needed the organ layer. Leaving it parked would have
  been the expensive half of the deferral rather than a neutral one: `vectors.json` is built
  on the maintainer's machine and bundled into the worker at `wrangler deploy`, so the
  deployed corpus is a snapshot of the last manual deploy and publishing an article does not
  change what chat retrieves. 9.1's `semantic_search` reads the same artifact and would
  inherit the same staleness on the day it shipped. The rest of Phase 11 stays parked.
- **D3 — the corpus vectors move to a shared `workers/lib/vectors.json`.** Chat and MCP both
  need them, and 9.1 step 3 already factors the shared retrieval code into `workers/lib/`;
  the artifact belongs beside it. One artifact, one skip registration per gate, and no way
  for two deployments to retrieve against different corpora. The three gates skip it by
  basename, so the move does not change what they scan. The 7.2a treatment is otherwise
  unchanged: still derived, still gitignored, still a `check-worker-config.mjs` failure if
  git ever tracks it.
- **D4 — `/kb/` + `llms.txt` is the primary AI-access path; MCP serves tool-only clients.**
  `dev_docs/research/platform-notes.md` §3.2 flagged this overlap as unsettled and said to
  settle it when Phase 9 is planned: the static protocol already serves any client that can
  fetch a URL, at zero infrastructure cost, which makes MCP unnecessary for browsing-capable
  clients. It is built anyway, because its remaining delta is real — clients that cannot
  fetch arbitrary URLs, a persistent registered tool a user opts into once instead of a URL
  they must remember, and `semantic_search`, which the static protocol cannot do at all. So
  the `/ai` page (9.2) leads with the HTTP protocol and presents the MCP endpoint second,
  matching how `dev_docs/PRD.md`'s consumer table already words it. This is a positioning
  decision, recorded so 9.2 does not re-open it.
- **D5 — `list_topics`, `get_article`, and `search` fetch the live site over HTTP with edge
  caching**, rather than bundling `/kb/` JSON into the worker at deploy time. Those files
  rebuild on every push to `main` and ship with the site, so the deployed site stays the
  single source and three of the four tools are current by construction. Bundling would have
  given all four the staleness problem D2 exists to remove, to save a cache-cold fetch.
  `semantic_search` is the only tool touching the bundled artifact.
- **D6 — CI may deploy the vector-carrying workers, which amends a standing rule.**
  `AGENTS.md` §Where things live says Workers are "Deployed by hand, never by CI" and
  `docs/runbook/DEPLOY.md` §Corpus embeddings calls the rebuild "a deliberate manual step";
  9.4 cannot exist under either sentence, so 9.4 carries the edits to both. The exception is
  narrow by construction and must stay that way: push to `main` only — never
  `pull_request`, which would expose the credential to fork PRs — opt-in through a
  repository secret whose absence makes the job no-op green, and least-privilege per
  `.agent-toolkit/rules/github-actions-least-privilege.md`. The maintainer weighed the cost
  and accepted it: this grants an adopter's CI deploy rights to their Cloudflare account,
  and the token is strictly broader than the local one documented today
  (`Workers AI: Read + Edit` for the embedding call **plus** `Workers Scripts: Edit` for the
  deploy). 9.4's DEPLOY.md section states the scopes, the blast radius, and the revocation
  path, because an adopter opting in deserves to read what they are opting into.

**Two stale premises corrected in the blocks below.** Both predate phases 6 and 7 shipping,
and converting 9.3 without fixing them would have produced a packet built on a false claim:

1. **9.3 and ADR 005 §5 both call Phase 9's `features.mcp` the first post-cut config-schema
   addition, and Phase 9 the first real feature-release upgrade.** Neither is true any more.
   Phase 6 shipped `features.feedback` + `workers.feedback`, Phase 7 shipped `features.chat`
   + `features.og` + six `workers.*` keys, and instance #1 adopted both through
   `/sekai-upgrade` (6.4, 7.4). 9.3 is re-scoped to write the adopter playbook **from the two
   real upgrade runs that already happened**, which is better evidence than one run and also
   unties the task from waiting on Phase 9's own adoption.
2. **9.3 as written spanned two repositories in one packet** — its steps 1, 3, and 4 commit
   in `sekai-kb` while step 2 runs in the instance. `.agent-toolkit/dev.md` requires a session
   to run in the repository that owns its commits, and the 2026-08-04 exit-gate amendment
   established the terminal-adoption-packet shape for exactly this. 9.3 keeps the framework
   doc work; the new **9.5** carries the instance-side exit gate, modelled on 6.4 and 7.4
   including its `Execution repo:` line.

- **Estimates:** Phase 9 becomes AI ≈ 9h | Human ≈ 1h (was AI 6h | Human 0.75h): 9.1 gains
  0.5h for D3's artifact move and the `workers/lib/` extraction, 9.4 brings 1.75h from 11.2,
  and 9.5 adds 0.75h. Phase 11 drops to AI ≈ 15.5h by losing 11.2. The totals paragraph above
  is re-summed from the per-phase subtotals.

## Phase 10 planning amendment — approved 2026-08-15

Records the architecture decision and `/dev:plan` conversion decisions for Phase 10. The
Phase 10 blocks below carry them inline; ADR 012 records the contested delivery choice.

- **D1 — analytics is an ephemeral production-build projection, not committed data.** The
  original block writes `src/data/analytics/*.json`, but `.gitignore` excludes all of
  `src/data/` and the Pages workflow builds from a clean checkout. A local fetch could never
  reach the deployed dashboard. The selected contract runs `npm run fetch:analytics` in the
  production build job before Astro, only on a push to `main`, and consumes the files in that
  same job. No snapshot enters git.
- **D2 — 10.2 splits into 10.2a and 10.2b.** Three provider clients plus normalization and
  API error handling are one independently testable concern; GitHub Actions credential
  gating plus dashboard rendering are another. The original M estimate put three external
  APIs, CI security, and a user-facing dashboard into 3h including review. That estimate was
  false, and a single packet would not converge in review.
- **D3 — public collection ids and private fetch inputs are separate.** The absent-safe
  optional config block is `analytics {ga4MeasurementId?,
  cloudflareWebAnalyticsToken?}`. It contains the two browser-visible ids only. Fetch inputs
  remain environment data: `GA4_PROPERTY_ID`, `SC_SITE_URL`,
  `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` locally, `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` in Actions,
  `CF_ZONE_ID`, and `CF_API_TOKEN`. Generated JSON and HTML carry none of those values.
- **D4 — the normalized schemas and partial-source behavior are contract, not dashboard
  improvisation.** SPEC §Analytics freezes the three versioned JSON shapes. Fetchers validate
  and atomically replace one source file each; one source failure does not erase another
  source's valid result, but the explicit command exits nonzero when any source fails. The
  dashboard renders a named unavailable state per missing/invalid source and never converts
  an API failure into zero traffic.
- **D5 — production availability survives analytics failure.** A repository with no Actions
  credentials skips the fetch green. An incomplete credential set or provider failure stays
  visible in the workflow, while `npm run build` proceeds with whatever valid source files
  exist. The credentialed step never runs on `pull_request`. Deferred task 11.5 is amended
  from a data-only PR, impossible for ignored files, to a scheduled rebuild/deploy of the
  current verified `main` SHA.
- **D6 — the v1 scripts are port sources, not contracts.** The packet records their local
  paths. The port removes place identity, multilingual aggregation, home-directory cache and
  virtualenv management, dated-history files, and hand-maintained dashboard merging. Current
  provider APIs are revalidated at execution; Python dependencies are added through uv.
- **Estimates:** Phase 10 becomes AI ≈ 9.25h | Human ≈ 1.75h (was AI 5h | Human 1.5h).
  10.1 stays 1.25h AI; 10.2a is 4.25h, 10.2b is 3h, and 10.3 is 0.75h. Human setup and live
  verification remain 1.5h; 10.2b adds 0.25h for the dashboard's desktop/mobile visual
  review. The totals paragraph above is re-summed from the per-phase subtotals.

## Phase 11/12 re-range amendment, approved 2026-08-18

Records the maintainer's decision to keep Phase 8 unscheduled, make Phase 11 the next
active phase, and move only independently gated integrations to Phase 12. ADR 013 records
the architecture decision; the blocks below carry it inline.

- **D1: operational scheduling no longer belongs to Semiont.** Phase 8 remains deferred,
  but its ROUTINE organ and its downstream relationship to Phase 11 are removed. Any future
  MEMORY integration belongs to Phase 8 or a separately approved post-Phase-8 milestone.
  Neither Phase 11 nor Phase 12 reads `semiont/`.
- **D2: Phase 11 uses native Claude Code cloud Routines plus GitHub Actions.** Native
  Routines own prompts, repositories, environments, connectors, triggers, pause state, and
  run history. The repository ships committed `sekai-*` skills and
  `docs/runbook/AUTOMATION.md`; it does not ship ROUTINE.md or a custom `/schedule` that
  collides with the native command. Deterministic jobs remain GitHub Actions. Platform
  behavior is research-preview state and is revalidated at planning and release.
- **D3: two old Phase 11 blocks move to Phase 12.** Old 11.4 becomes 12.1 because
  feedback writes still require explicit approval of an exact plan. Old 11.7 becomes 12.2
  because no real platform adapter or enabled first-instance social account exists. New
  12.3 is the Phase 12 release, adoption, and live-integration gate. Those are scope moves,
  not cuts.
- **D4: feedback approval stays human and exact.** The scheduled routine runs
  `/sekai-triage-feedback --dry-run` and stops. The maintainer explicitly approves that
  exact plan in the same routine session; the skill then performs its existing byte-exact
  revalidation before writes. A saved prompt, trigger, silence, or standing instruction is
  never approval.
- **D5: social publishing waits for evidence, not Phase 8.** A real account selects the
  platform and current API. The adapter must preserve the queue's human `approved` gate and
  make retries idempotent before automation can post. Phase 12 stays unscheduled until that
  trigger and the feedback-approval readiness gate are both explicit.
- **D6: success is an external effect, not a green routine badge.** Native documentation
  states that green means the session exited without an infrastructure error. Each block
  therefore names the pull request, review, issue, deployment timestamp, D1 row, or remote
  post that proves success. Repository-changing routines use `claude/` branches and PRs;
  content always waits for human merge.
- **Estimates:** Phase 11 becomes AI ≈ 12.5h | Human ≈ 1.25h. Its native-platform contract
  is 2.5h AI; content review/health is 3h; analytics refresh is 1.25h; trend discovery is
  2.5h; rewrite is 2.5h; exit is 0.75h. Phase 12 is AI ≈ 7.5h | Human ≈ 1.25h: feedback
  approval bridge 3.75h, social adapter/routine 3h, exit 0.75h. The totals paragraph above
  is re-summed from these subtotals.

---

## Detailed task blocks: Phases 6-8

These are the active source blocks for `/dev:plan`. Model names are advisory and
version-less; the maintainer chooses the session model. Every task executes in
`sekai-kb`, ships in a tagged release, and reaches an instance through `/sekai-upgrade`
unless its packet names an instance-owned edit — 6.4 is the one block that does, and it
names the instance in its own `Execution repo:` line.

**Phase 6: Social + engagement**

```text
[6.1a] Feedback backend: workers/feedback (Cloudflare Worker + D1)
  Effort: M | Model: Opus | Depends: framework cut
  Est: AI 2h + 0.5h review | Human 0.5h (Cloudflare account, wrangler auth, secrets)
  Steps:
    1. Build workers/feedback/ with D1 schema feedback(id, created_at, page, category,
       message, contact, user_agent, status).
    2. Expose POST with a honeypot field, per-IP rate limiting, and CORS locked to the
       configured site origin. Check in wrangler.toml and add exact deploy steps to the
       runbook.
  Acceptance: a curl POST against the deployed worker lands a row in D1; honeypot and
    rate-limit paths are verified
  Downstream: 6.1b, 12.1

[6.1b] Feedback frontend: widget behind features.feedback + workers.feedback
  Effort: S | Model: Opus | Depends: 6.1a
  Est: AI 1h + 0.25h review
  Steps:
    1. Build FeedbackWidget.astro on article pages behind features.feedback. Reuse no
       Supabase-shaped code from the inherited fork.
    2. Add the absent-safe workers.feedback endpoint key (wizard prompt table entry; the
       wizard stays the single writer of place.config.ts).
  Acceptance: a live-site submission lands in D1; the widget is absent with either the
    flag off or the endpoint key missing
  Downstream: 6.4

[6.1c] Feedback triage: /sekai-triage-feedback (D1 -> deduplicated GitHub issues)
  Effort: S | Model: Opus | Depends: 6.1a
  Est: AI 1h + 0.25h review
  Steps:
    1. Build the skill: read status='new' rows through wrangler, classify, deduplicate,
       file GitHub issues linking the article, mark rows triaged with the issue URL.
    2. Gate every write behind explicit human approval, as /sekai-seed-articles does.
  Acceptance: triage produces a GitHub issue; a duplicate comments instead of filing a
    second one
  Downstream: 6.4, 12.1

[6.2] Snippet pipeline: skill + inbox + adapter interface + manual-sink runner
  Effort: M | Model: Sonnet | Depends: framework cut
  Est: AI 2.5h + 0.5h review
  Steps:
    1. Build /sekai-snippet: select article, generate short-form draft, append it to
       knowledge/SNIPPET-INBOX.md with status pending. A human changes pending to approved.
    2. Define the platform-adapter interface. Add no platform adapter until an instance
       account exists; then add one adapter per platform.
    3. Ship the runner plus a manual sink so approved -> posted is reachable without any
       platform API (2026-07-29 amendment, decision D3).
  Acceptance: /sekai-snippet <article> yields an approved-queue entry; the runner marks it
    posted through the manual sink; publish posts to a platform after an account and
    adapter are wired
  Downstream: 6.4, 12.2

[6.3] Soundscape page + manifest contract + demo audio
  Effort: M | Model: Sonnet | Depends: framework cut
  Est: AI 1.5h + 0.5h review
  Steps:
    1. Build the page from the archived soundscape template as design reference, behind
       features.soundscape.
    2. Define knowledge/sounds/ manifest entries with title, location, credit, and file.
       Use native HTML5 audio and no player library.
    3. Ship three synthesized demo clips so the player and the visual bar are provable in
       the template; the wizard strips them at adoption. The three real recordings are
       instance-side work in 6.4 (2026-07-29 amendment, decision D1).
  Acceptance: audio plays on mobile Safari; the page passes the visual bar; an absent
    manifest renders the empty state with a green build
  Downstream: 6.4

[6.3b] Soundscape layout: manifest categories, card grid, wishlist, contribute block
  Effort: M/L | Model: Opus | Depends: 6.3
  Est: AI 3.5h + 0.75h review
  Steps:
    1. Extend knowledge/sounds/_manifest.md to an ordered categories list (id, icon, title,
       optional article link), each carrying its recordings and a wishlist of sounds still
       wanted; a flat sounds list still renders as one implicit category.
    2. Normalize both shapes in src/lib/sounds.ts, validate every new field with a named
       warning, and keep the three absent-safe cases identical.
    3. Rebuild the template: hero stats, one anchored section per category, a responsive
       card grid with the richer card, per-category empty state and wishlist, and a
       contribute block. No player library, no client framework, zero script tags.
  Acceptance: the page passes the visual bar at desktop and mobile widths; an existing flat
    manifest renders unchanged; an absent manifest still renders the empty state green
  Downstream: 6.3c, 6.4

[6.3c] Soundscape ingest: npm run sounds:add, manifest validation gate, authoring playbook
  Effort: M | Model: Opus | Depends: 6.3b
  Est: AI 2.5h + 0.5h review
  Decision: hand-writing manifest entries and shipping the tool later writes them twice, and
    validates the exit gate against a path the framework does not support. Build the tool
    first; 6.4 DoD 6 uses it to produce the three real recordings.
  Steps:
    1. Build scripts/ci/check-sounds.mjs (npm run sounds:check): imports the five field
       arrays from src/lib/sounds.ts, exits nonzero on missing required fields / unresolved
       file / path-escape / duplicate category id. Orphan mp3s are reported but do not fail.
    2. Build scripts/tools/sounds/add.mjs (npm run sounds:add): takes input audio paths +
       metadata, places/converts to public/media/sounds/<slug>.mp3, appends YAML entry to
       the manifest. Strictly additive; preserves surrounding bytes.
    3. Write docs/playbook/SOUNDSCAPE-PLAYBOOK.md: record, convert, add, verify, commit.
    4. Wire sounds:check into postbuild and CI; add sounds:selftest to CI.
  Acceptance: npm run sounds:add on a fixture produces a valid manifest that passes
    sounds:check; the self-test proves every failure class; genericity passes
  Downstream: 6.3d, 6.4

[6.3d] Soundscape ingest strips recording metadata: strip on write, gate on check
  Effort: M | Model: Opus | Depends: 6.3c
  Est: AI 1.5h + 0.25h review
  Decision: stripping is unconditional, with no opt-out flag. The manifest asks for a
    human-written location string precisely so the place is described in the instance's own
    words; shipping exact coordinates underneath it contradicts that field's purpose.
  Steps:
    1. Write every published file through ffmpeg with metadata, chapter, and ID3 writing
       disabled, on the conversion path and on the mp3 path alike. mp3 input is re-muxed
       (-c:a copy, lossless) rather than copied, which makes ffmpeg an unconditional
       prerequisite of npm run sounds:add.
    2. Extend sounds:check to scan every published mp3 and fail on any metadata tag or a
       wrong container. CI has no ffmpeg, and the gate also runs from an adopter's postbuild,
       so the container read is JavaScript and never shells out to ffprobe.
    3. Share the strip arguments and the container reader between writer and gate so the
       tool and the gate that judges it cannot drift.
    4. Extend sounds:selftest with one planted case per tag container; document the strip,
       the gate, and the non-retroactive remedy in the soundscape playbook.
  Acceptance: a tagged fixture converts and re-muxes to a file with no tag; the gate fails on
    each planted tag form naming the file and the field, and passes on the shipped tree; the
    release entry carries an upgrade note, because the fix is not retroactive to assets an
    adopter has already committed
  Downstream: 6.4

[6.4] Phase 6 exit gate: ship the tag, adopt it in the instance, go live
  Effort: M | Model: Opus | Depends: 6.1b, 6.1c, 6.2, 6.3, 6.3b, 6.3c, 6.3d
  Est: AI 1h + 0.25h review | Human 2.5h (Cloudflare setup, three recordings, confirm)
  Execution repo: the instance (every commit); the tag is cut in sekai-kb at verify of the
    last framework task.
  Steps:
    1. Cut the sekai-kb release covering 6.1a-6.3; adopt it with /sekai-upgrade (real merge
       commit, instance-owned files untouched, FRAMEWORK-VERSION bumped after verification).
    2. Enable features.feedback + workers.feedback + features.soundscape; deploy the
       instance's own worker, D1, and secrets.
    3. Record, convert, and commit the three real recordings with manifest entries.
  Acceptance: production submission -> D1 -> real GitHub issue; three recordings play on
    mobile Safari on the deployed site; maintainer phase confirm
  Downstream: Phase 7 entry
```

_Phase 6 subtotal: AI 20.25h | Human 3h_ (the three post-6.3 amendments; the earlier
16.25h/2.5h figure predated 6.3b, 6.3c, and 6.3d and is what the totals paragraph above
now re-sums from)

**Phase 7: Differentiators**

```text
[7.1] On-demand OG worker (Satori + resvg-wasm)
  Effort: M | Model: Sonnet | Depends: framework cut
  Est: AI 2.5h + 0.5h review
  Steps:
    1. Build workers/og/: GET /og/{slug}.png. Render title, category color, and site brand
       from /kb/topics.json data through Satori and resvg-wasm. Return long-lived cache
       headers and cache at the Cloudflare edge.
    2. Switch SEO.astro og:image to the worker URL behind a feature flag; retain static
       og-default.png as fallback.
  Acceptance: og:image URLs render per-article cards; cached responses complete in <200ms
  Downstream: 7.2a

[7.2a] Corpus embeddings: build-embeddings.mjs + gitignored static vectors
  Effort: M | Model: Opus | Depends: 7.1
  Est: AI 2.5h + 0.5h review | Human 0h
  Research: dev_docs/research/platform-notes.md §2 (RAG architecture, chunking, bge-m3
    constraints, Workers AI cost, V8 CPU budget, code skeleton)
  Decision: one embedding provider ships, Workers AI REST (2026-08-05 amendment, D2); the
    artifact is derived and gitignored because it carries place content into a tree that
    forbids place identity (D3). The port source's path is in the packet, not here (D6 note).
  Steps:
    1. Read the v1 build-embeddings.mjs named in the packet, and platform-notes.md §2, then
       port: chunk articles at 300-500 tokens on ## headings; embed with bge-m3 at 1024
       dimensions through the Workers AI REST API. Take the int8 unit quantization, the flat
       N x DIM layout, and the versioned manifest; leave the Ollama provider, the
       article-level embed text, the category map, and the language loop behind.
    2. Emit workers/chat/vectors.json, gitignored, with the skip entry in both machine gates
       and a check-worker-config.mjs failure if git ever tracks it.
    3. Keep it out of the prebuild chain: the site build stays green with no Cloudflare
       credentials. CI automation is 11.2's job.
  Acceptance: vectors cover every article (a zero-chunk article fails the run by name); chunk
    metadata includes title, url, category, and heading; the chunker's suite runs in CI with
    no network
  Downstream: 7.2b, 9.1, 11.2

[7.2b] Chat worker: query embedding + cosine retrieval + free-tier generation
  Effort: M | Model: Opus | Depends: 7.2a
  Est: AI 3h + 0.5h review | Human 0.25h (Workers AI binding + deploy)
  Decision: generation is Workers AI free tier, not the Claude API (2026-08-05 amendment,
    D1). This packet carries the two SPEC edits that ruling requires — §Stack's generation
    bullet and §New builds (6) — and keeps their not-pinned-here discipline: the model id is
    chosen against the current Workers AI catalog at execution time, never copied from the
    dated research.
  Steps:
    1. Build workers/chat/. Embed queries through Workers AI @cf/baai/bge-m3; decode the
       7.2a vectors once into global scope and retrieve by cosine; prompt a free-tier
       Workers AI text model with citation-required prompting; stream the response, ending
       with a machine-readable citation payload so no consumer parses prose.
    2. Lock CORS to the deploy-time origin and rate-limit per hashed IP, as workers/feedback
       does — a public endpoint that spends the shared 10k neurons/day allowance needs both.
  Acceptance: the deployed worker streams an answer from article content with citations, and
    refuses rather than inventing one when the corpus has no support
  Downstream: 7.2c, 9.1

[7.2c] /chat page + evaluation set
  Effort: M | Model: Opus | Depends: 7.2b
  Est: AI 2h + 0.5h review | Human 1h (review evaluation answers)
  Decision: the evaluation set lives in knowledge/chat/_eval.md, not workers/chat/eval/
    (2026-08-05 amendment, D4) — the questions are about the place.
  Steps:
    1. Build /chat in vanilla JS; render the worker's citation payload as linked cards.
    2. Write the 10-question evaluation set, eight answerable and two that must be refused,
       and run it against the live worker with npm run chat:eval.
  Acceptance: the evaluation set is answered from articles with citations and no
    hallucinated places; the runner exits nonzero on any citation that does not resolve to
    a real article
  Downstream: 7.3, 9.1

[7.3] QR flow: location-context deep links + printable codes
  Effort: S | Model: Sonnet | Depends: 7.2c
  Est: AI 1h + 0.25h review
  Decision: contexts live in knowledge/chat/_contexts.md and the sheet is npm run qr:sheet,
    not a public route (2026-08-05 amendment, D5).
  Steps:
    1. Add a ctx-param map from location slug to location-aware greeting and retrieval hint.
       The hint joins the embedded query, never the generation prompt.
    2. Add a printable QR sheet that generates codes for physical locations.
  Acceptance: scanning a location code opens /chat with a location-aware greeting
  Downstream: 7.4

[7.4] Phase 7 exit gate: ship the tag, adopt it in the instance, go live
  Effort: S | Model: Opus | Depends: 7.1, 7.2c, 7.3
  Est: AI 1h + 0.25h review | Human 1.25h (Cloudflare setup, eval review, printed QR
    placements)
  Execution repo: the instance (every commit); the tag is cut in sekai-kb at verify of the
    last framework task.
  Steps:
    1. Cut the sekai-kb release covering 7.1-7.3, with an upgrade note for the chat and OG
       config keys; adopt it with /sekai-upgrade (real merge commit, instance-owned files
       untouched, instance CI green, FRAMEWORK-VERSION bumped after verification).
    2. Enable features.chat and features.og; build the instance's own vectors and deploy its
       own chat and og workers with the Workers AI binding. No third-party API key exists
       to provision (2026-08-05 amendment, D1).
    3. Write the instance's own evaluation set, choose its QR locations and their ctx slugs,
       and print the sheet.
  Acceptance: the deployed instance answers the evaluation set from its own articles with
    citations; og:image renders per-article cards in a real social preview; a scanned
    location code opens /chat with that location's greeting; maintainer phase confirm
  Downstream: Phase 9 entry; Phase 8 remains independently schedulable
```

_Phase 7 subtotal: AI 14.5h | Human 2.5h_

**Phase 8: Semiont plugin layer — DEFERRED, unscheduled**

**Deferred by the 2026-08-12 amendment (D1); amended by ADR 013.** The blocks stay
convertible: `/dev:plan` runs against them whenever a maintainer schedules this phase.
Nothing in phases 9 or 10 requires the organ layer, and `AGENTS.md` §Semiont probe already
requires every skill and script to no-op gracefully while `semiont/config.json` is absent.
ADR 013 removes the ROUTINE organ and every downstream operations dependency. No scheduled
phase depends on 8.1.

The agent-toolkit migration amendment above controls the `AGENTS.md` boot-hook location
and supersedes the original `CLAUDE.md` loader wording.

```text
[8.1] Organ architecture in sekai-kb: semiont/config.json + loader + core organs
  Effort: M | Model: Opus | Depends: framework cut
  Est: AI 2.5h + 0.5h review
  Steps:
    1. Add semiont/config.json plus organs/{memory,reflexes,manifesto,diary,
       introspection}/ scaffolds. The site build never imports semiont/; CI must prove a
       build succeeds with the directory absent.
    2. Seed a stable one-paragraph boot hook into starter AGENTS.md. It reads config.json,
       loads enabled organ boot files, and no-ops when config is absent. Core organs are
       MEMORY.md and REFLEXES.md; total boot read remains below 150 lines.
    3. Enforce ADR 003: no organ reads another organ's files; every skill probes for organ
       existence and no-ops gracefully when absent.
  Acceptance: site builds with semiont/ absent; disabling an organ removes its boot cost
  Downstream: 8.2

[8.2] Instance #1 enables core + MANIFESTO; DIARY and INTROSPECTION stay off
  Effort: S | Model: Sonnet | Depends: 8.1
  Est: AI 1h + 0.25h review
  Steps:
    1. Enable memory, reflexes, and manifesto in the instance's semiont/config.json.
    2. Salvage MANIFESTO prose by hand from the v1 archive; the organ shell is new.
  Acceptance: the AGENTS.md boot hook reads <150 lines; organs toggle through config only
  Downstream: 8.3

[8.3] Phase 8 exit gate: ship the tag, adopt it in the instance
  Effort: S | Model: Sonnet | Depends: 8.1, 8.2
  Est: AI 0.5h + 0.25h review | Human 0.5h (MANIFESTO prose, confirm)
  Execution repo: the instance (every commit); the tag is cut in sekai-kb at verify of the
    last framework task.
  Steps:
    1. Cut the sekai-kb release covering 8.1, with an upgrade note for the semiont/
       config.json manifest and the AGENTS.md boot hook (a starter-diff change, surfaced
       conversationally by /sekai-upgrade rather than merged silently).
    2. Adopt it with /sekai-upgrade (real merge commit, instance-owned files untouched,
       instance CI green, FRAMEWORK-VERSION bumped after verification).
    3. Turn on memory, reflexes, and manifesto in the instance's semiont/config.json;
       leave diary and introspection off.
  Acceptance: the instance builds with semiont/ deleted and with it present; its enabled
    organ set matches its config and nothing else loads; maintainer phase confirm
  Downstream: none; no scheduled phase depends on Phase 8
```

## Detailed task blocks: Phases 9-12

`/dev:plan` converts packets from here; Steps/Acceptance text governs packet detail.
Model policy: all execution Opus (2026-07-07); reviews follow `.agent-toolkit/dev.md`
defaults. Decisions behind these blocks (scheduler substrate, ship mode, analytics stack,
release train): ADR 005 as amended by ADR 011, ADR 012, and ADR 013.

**Phase 9: MCP + AI delivery**
```
[9.1] MCP server worker (workers/mcp/)
  Effort: M | Model: Opus | Depends: 7.2c (named MCP trigger honored)
  Est: AI 3h + 0.5h review | Human 0.25h (wrangler route, client test)
  Decision: the shared corpus artifact moves to workers/lib/vectors.json (2026-08-12
    amendment, D3), and the three HTTP-backed tools read the live site rather than a
    bundled copy (D5). Only semantic_search touches the artifact.
  Steps:
    1. Stateless Streamable-HTTP MCP server on Cloudflare Workers (createMcpHandler
       pattern; no Durable Objects at single-instance scale — verified free-tier viable
       2026-07, see ADR 005; document McpAgent/DO as the scale-up path for adopters
       needing sessions).
    2. Tools: list_topics (fetches /kb/topics.json), get_article (slug →
       /kb/articles/{category}/{slug}.md), search (keyword over /kb/search-index.json),
       semantic_search (query embed via Workers AI @cf/baai/bge-m3 + in-worker cosine
       over the 7.2a vectors). The first three fetch the deployed site with edge caching
       per D5, so they carry no build-time copy and stale on nothing.
    3. Factor the retrieval code shared with workers/chat into workers/lib/; surgical
       refactor of the chat worker to consume it. Move the vectors artifact there in the
       same change (D3): build-embeddings.mjs's output path, the chat worker's import,
       .gitignore, and the worker-config self-test fixtures. The gates skip it by
       basename, so their scan sets do not change; its derived-and-gitignored treatment
       from 7.2a (D3 of the 2026-08-05 amendment) carries over unchanged.
    4. Place identity from config; new feature flag features.mcp plus workers.mcp
       (absent-safe schema extension, links-precedent note in SPEC; init-wizard prompt
       tracked; scripts/init/writer.mjs's copy must stay in agreement — place-config:check
       enforces it).
  Acceptance: an MCP client connected to the deployed endpoint answers a question about
    the instance's place via tool calls; genericity CI green; chat worker eval (7.2c set)
    still passes post-refactor
  Downstream: 9.2, 9.4
[9.2] AI-access page + agent boot file
  Effort: S | Model: Opus | Depends: 9.1
  Est: AI 1h + 0.25h review
  Decision: the page leads with /kb/ + llms.txt and presents MCP second, for clients that
    cannot fetch arbitrary URLs and for semantic_search (2026-08-12 amendment, D4). This
    settles the overlap platform-notes.md §3.2 left open; do not re-open it in the packet.
  Steps:
    1. /ai page (successor to the inherited-fork MCP page) documenting every AI
       consumption path — llms.txt, /kb/ protocol, MCP endpoint + client config snippets,
       /chat — all generated from place.config, in D4's order.
    2. build-kb-index.mjs additionally emits /kb/agent.md: a vendor-agnostic boot file
       (identity, voice, topic index, fetch instructions), genericized; llms.txt links it.
  Acceptance: a browsing AI given only the domain can enumerate and use all access paths;
    genericity CI green
  Downstream: none
[9.3] Adopter upgrade playbook (docs/runbook/UPGRADE.md) + the absent-safe schema rule
  Effort: S | Model: Opus | Depends: framework cut
  Est: AI 1.5h + 0.25h review | Human 0.25h (read it as a first-timer would)
  Decision: written FROM the two real feature-release upgrades that already happened —
    6.4 and 7.4 — not from Phase 9's own adoption (2026-08-12 amendment, correction 1).
    features.mcp is not the first post-cut config-schema addition; features.feedback,
    features.soundscape, features.chat, and features.og all preceded it. Two completed
    runs are better evidence than one, and sourcing from them unblocks this task from
    9.5. The instance-side adoption that used to be this block's step 2 is now 9.5
    (correction 2): a packet commits in one repository.
  Steps:
    1. Read docs/runbook/UPGRADE.md first. It has been hardened repeatedly since Phase 5
       (maintainer-doc classification, FRAMEWORK-VERSION survival, divergence reporting),
       so state what this task adds rather than re-describing what is there.
    2. Extend it for adopters from the 6.4 and 7.4 runs: discover releases (watch tags /
       CHANGELOG), read upgrade notes, run /sekai-upgrade (AI path) or the manual
       fetch → merge-tag → build commands (non-AI path), handle conflict reports, enable
       newly added feature flags (absent-safe: skipping the flag = feature stays off),
       verify FRAMEWORK-VERSION bumped.
    3. Add the absent-safe schema rule to sekai-kb's AGENTS.md + playbook so future
       framework changes preserve it (per ADR 006, CLAUDE.md is a one-line @AGENTS.md
       shim — never content-bearing).
  Acceptance: a first-timer following UPGRADE.md alone can state the exact commands and
    the flag to flip for a newly released feature, citing the 6.4/7.4 runs as the worked
    examples
  Downstream: every later framework release ships against this playbook
[9.4] Corpus + index refresh pipeline (CI-triggered, deterministic)
  Effort: S | Model: Opus | Depends: 7.2a, 9.1
  Est: AI 1.5h + 0.25h review
  Decision: pulled forward from 11.2 (2026-08-12 amendment, D2) because its dependencies
    were never 8.1, and without it both chat and the new semantic_search retrieve against
    whatever corpus was bundled at the last manual deploy. This block is what makes CI
    deploy a Worker, which the amendment's D6 permits by narrow exception; the AGENTS.md
    and DEPLOY.md edits that exception requires land HERE, in the task whose code proves
    them, not in a separate docs pass.
  Steps:
    1. GH Actions job on push-to-main touching knowledge/**: rebuild chunk vectors via
       Workers AI @cf/baai/bge-m3 (single-instance scale fits the 10k-neurons/day free
       tier; the offline GPU path stays documented as the alternative per SPEC `Stack`),
       and redeploy the workers that bundle workers/lib/vectors.json.
    2. Fail safe by default: push to main only, never pull_request; the job no-ops green
       when the credential secret is absent, so an adopter who never opts in keeps a green
       CI and the hand-deploy path; permissions: contents: read at the top level with
       write scopes only on the job that needs them.
    3. Amend AGENTS.md §Where things live and docs/runbook/DEPLOY.md §Corpus embeddings,
       both of which currently state that Workers are deployed by hand and never by CI.
       Document the token scopes the job needs (Workers AI: Read + Edit for the embedding
       call, Workers Scripts: Edit for the deploy), what an adopter grants by opting in,
       and how to revoke.
    4. Verify + document that search/kb/graph indexes already rebuild on every deploy
       (no gap).
  Acceptance: editing an article on main updates chat + MCP retrieval within one deploy
    cycle, no manual step; a checkout with no Cloudflare secret configured still goes green
  Downstream: 9.5
[9.5] Phase 9 exit gate: ship the tag, adopt it in the instance, connect a real client
  Effort: S | Model: Opus | Depends: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4
  Est: AI 0.5h + 0.25h review | Human 0.5h (Cloudflare deploy, MCP client registration,
    confirm)
  Execution repo: the instance (every commit); the tag is cut in sekai-kb at verify of the
    last framework task.
  Steps:
    1. Cut the sekai-kb release covering 9.1-9.4, with an upgrade note for features.mcp +
       workers.mcp and one for the CI refresh job's opt-in secret; adopt it with
       /sekai-upgrade (real merge commit, instance-owned files untouched, instance CI
       green, FRAMEWORK-VERSION bumped after verification).
    2. Enable features.mcp, deploy the instance's own MCP worker, and set its endpoint in
       place.config.
    3. Register the endpoint in a real MCP client and ask it a question about the place.
       No clone: the proof is that a client which has never seen the repository answers
       from the instance's articles through tool calls.
  Acceptance: the connected client answers from the instance's own articles with no clone;
    an article edited on main reaches its retrieval within one deploy cycle; maintainer
    phase confirm
  Downstream: Phase 10 entry
```

_Phase 9 subtotal: AI 9h | Human 1h_

**Phase 10: Perception (analytics)**
```
[10.1] Analytics wiring behind features.analytics
  Effort: S | Model: Opus | Depends: a live domain; scheduled post-9
  Est: AI 1h + 0.25h review | Human 0.5h (create GA4 property, verify Search Console,
    enable CF Web Analytics)
  Decision: browser-visible ids live in the absent-safe optional config block
    analytics {ga4MeasurementId?, cloudflareWebAnalyticsToken?}; fetch credentials and
    account-scoped API identifiers do not (2026-08-15 amendment, D3).
  Steps:
    1. Cloudflare Web Analytics beacon + GA4 gtag injected by HeadInlineScripts only when
       features.analytics is true and that provider's own id is non-empty. The two
       providers gate independently; missing analytics or features.analytics injects none.
    2. Add the optional analytics block to the single PlaceConfig declaration plus two
       init-wizard prompt rows. The wizard remains the single config writer and
       place-config:check remains the drift gate.
    3. Runbook gains account-setup steps: GA4 property and web stream, Search Console
       domain verification, CF Web Analytics in manual-snippet mode so automatic injection
       cannot duplicate the committed beacon.
  Acceptance: beacons fire on the live site with the flag on, absent with it off; zero
    analytics IDs in src/ outside place.config; each provider remains absent when only its
    own id is missing
  Downstream: 10.2a, 10.3, 11.5
[10.2a] Signal fetchers + normalized analytics schemas
  Effort: M/L | Model: Opus | Depends: 10.1, quality tooling
  Est: AI 3.5h + 0.75h review | Human 0.5h (API credentials/secrets)
  Decision: src/data/analytics is ignored derived output consumed by the build, never a
    cache history or commit surface (2026-08-15 amendment, D1). SPEC §Analytics owns the
    three schemaVersion:1 payloads and the strict/atomic error contract (D4).
  Steps:
    1. Port fetch-ga4.py / fetch-search-console.py / fetch-cloudflare.py from the v1
       archive as sources, not verbatim implementations: remove place identity,
       multilingual branches, home-directory cache/venv management, dated history, and
       dashboard-file merging. Revalidate each current provider API.
    2. Emit ga4.json, search-console.json, and cloudflare.json behind
       `npm run fetch:analytics`, with the exact normalized schemas in SPEC §Analytics.
       Write atomically; validate numeric types and required fields before replace.
    3. Run providers independently and return nonzero after all finish if any failed. A
       provider failure leaves no malformed file and is never represented as zero traffic.
    4. Add Python SDK dependencies through uv and a network-free fixture suite covering all
       three success shapes, invalid/missing API fields, missing credentials, redaction,
       atomic failure, and partial-source completion.
    5. Document local environment inputs and Actions secret inputs in the runbook.
  Acceptance: `npm run fetch:analytics` refreshes all three schema-valid JSON files from
    fixture APIs; the network-free suite proves every error/redaction class; an explicit
    credential-absent fetch fails by name; `npm run build` still passes with the directory
    absent
  Downstream: 10.2b
[10.2b] Production-build analytics delivery + dashboard panels
  Effort: M | Model: Opus | Depends: 10.2a
  Est: AI 2.5h + 0.5h review | Human 0.25h (desktop/mobile dashboard visual review)
  Decision: fetch ephemerally in the production Pages build of main (2026-08-15 amendment,
    D1/D5). No credentialed analytics step runs on pull_request and no JSON is committed.
  Steps:
    1. Add a guarded pre-build analytics step to deploy.yml: push to main only; a complete
       credential set runs 10.2a before Astro; no credentials skips green; an incomplete set
       or provider failure is visible while the site build continues.
    2. Dashboard gains GA4 traffic, Search Console search-performance, and Cloudflare edge-
       traffic panels. Each shows its own period and fetchedAt. Prefer static cards/lists;
       add Chart.js only if a chart materially improves the selected metric.
    3. Hide the analytics section when features.analytics is false. With it true, render one
       named unavailable state per missing/invalid source while preserving the other source
       panels and the existing article-health dashboard.
    4. Extend the dashboard postbuild check and add a workflow contract test for no PR
       credential path, complete/missing/partial secret gates, fetch-before-build ordering,
       ignored output, and absence of planted secret/account values from JSON and dist/.
  Acceptance: a fixture-backed production-build simulation fetches then renders all three
    panels; each missing/invalid source degrades independently; PR and credential-absent
    builds are green and never run a credentialed step; no secret/account identifier reaches
    generated JSON or rendered HTML; the dashboard is readable without overflow at desktop
    and mobile widths
  Downstream: 10.3, 11.5, 11.6

[10.3] Phase 10 exit gate: ship the tag, adopt it in the instance, go live
  Effort: S | Model: Sonnet | Depends: 10.1, 10.2a, 10.2b
  Est: AI 0.5h + 0.25h review | Human 0.5h (GA4 property, Search Console verification,
    CF Web Analytics token, fetcher credentials as Actions secrets)
  Execution repo: the instance (every commit); the tag is cut in sekai-kb at verify of the
    last framework task.
  Steps:
    1. Cut the sekai-kb release covering 10.1-10.2b, with an upgrade note for the optional
       analytics config block and production-build fetch opt-in (absent-safe: a missing
       block means analytics stays off and credential-absent builds stay green).
    2. Adopt it with /sekai-upgrade (real merge commit, instance-owned files untouched,
       instance CI green, FRAMEWORK-VERSION bumped after verification).
    3. Enable features.analytics, add the instance's own browser ids, and register
       GA4_PROPERTY_ID, SC_SITE_URL, GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON, CF_ZONE_ID, and
       CF_API_TOKEN as Actions secrets.
  Acceptance: beacons fire on the live instance with the flag on and are absent with it
    off; the production workflow fetches real data and the deployed dashboard shows all
    three source panels with their periods; no configured secret/account value appears in
    the workflow artifact or site; maintainer phase confirm
  Downstream: Phase 11 entry
```

_Phase 10 subtotal: AI 9.25h | Human 1.75h_

**Phase 11: Operational automation - NEXT**

**Re-ranged by the 2026-08-18 amendment; ADR 013.** This phase uses native Claude Code
cloud Routines plus GitHub Actions and has no Phase 8 dependency. Old 11.4 and 11.7 move
to Phase 12 because their blockers are human approval and a real social account, not
Semiont. Task 11.2 remains delivered as 9.4.

```
[11.1] Native automation contract + operator runbook
  Effort: M | Model: Opus | Depends: Phase 10 exit; not Phase 8
  Est: AI 2h + 0.5h review | Human 0.25h (register and pause the proof routine)
  Decision: native Claude Code cloud Routines own agentic scheduling and account state;
    GitHub Actions owns deterministic jobs. The repository ships no ROUTINE.md registry
    and no custom /schedule skill (2026-08-18 amendment, D1/D2; ADR 013).
  Steps:
    1. Revalidate current native Routine availability, CLI version floors, schedule and
       GitHub triggers, default-branch clone behavior, claude/ branch behavior, run status
       semantics, pause/removal controls, connector/environment scoping, and limits against
       official documentation. Record the as-of date in docs/runbook/AUTOMATION.md.
    2. Write AUTOMATION.md as a reproducible registration guide. Every routine template
       names its trigger, committed skill, repository, model, connector/environment
       allowlist, ship mode, observable success evidence, manual fallback, pause, and
       removal procedure. It is not a shadow registry.
    3. Amend AGENTS.md's Semiont probe and adopter-emitted copy: Semiont carries identity
       and memory only; operations have no semiont/ dependency. Preserve the absent-safe
       probe for every skill and script.
    4. Prove the contract with one no-op cloud Routine: register, run, inspect its transcript,
       pause it, prove it does not run, then remove it. A green badge alone is not success.
  Acceptance: the runbook can reproduce the no-op routine from a fresh operator account;
    its run transcript proves execution; pause stops it; removal leaves no claimed registry
    state in the repository; the site builds with semiont/ absent
  Downstream: 11.3, 11.5, 11.6, 11.8, 12.1, 12.2

[11.2] MOVED to 9.4 by the 2026-08-12 amendment (D2). Its dependencies were 7.2a + 9.1,
  never Phase 8, and deferring it would have shipped 9.1's semantic_search against a corpus
  that only refreshed on a manual deploy. Nothing remains here; the block lives in Phase 9.

[11.3] Content PR review + scheduled link/health audit
  Effort: M | Model: Opus | Depends: 11.1, quality tooling
  Est: AI 2.5h + 0.5h review
  Steps:
    1. Add a committed content-review skill and a native pull-request-triggered Routine
       registration template. The skill inspects changed paths and exits without comment
       when no knowledge/** article changed; otherwise it posts one editorial + fact-check
       review sourced from the playbook. Draft PRs stay excluded.
    2. Add a scheduled maintenance skill and Routine template that runs the internal-link
       check plus article-health sweep. File idempotently titled GitHub issues labeled
       content-maintenance for regressions; those issues are the 11.8 rewrite queue.
    3. Scope the review routine to the repository only. Scope the maintenance routine to
       repository + GitHub issue writes only. Neither receives unrelated connectors or
       permission to push the default branch.
  Acceptance: a contributor content PR receives the playbook-based review; a non-content
    PR receives none; a planted broken link produces one content-maintenance issue and a
    rerun does not duplicate it
  Downstream: 11.8

[11.4] MOVED to 12.1 by the 2026-08-18 amendment (D3). Feedback writes require explicit
  approval of the exact dry-run plan; Phase 12 preserves that gate without Phase 8.

[11.5] Scheduled analytics refresh
  Effort: S | Model: Opus | Depends: 11.1, 10.2b
  Est: AI 1h + 0.25h review
  Decision: ADR 012 makes analytics JSON an ignored production-build projection. A
    data-only PR cannot carry it and would be empty, so GitHub Actions schedules a rebuild
    and deploy of the current default-branch SHA; it changes no branch and pushes nothing.
  Steps:
    1. Add a daily schedule trigger to the 10.2b production path. Resolve the current
       default-branch SHA once, then check out, fetch, build, and deploy that same SHA.
    2. Preserve 10.2b's credential boundary: no pull-request credential path; absent secrets
       skip green; incomplete credentials or provider failures stay visible; least-privilege
       permissions and concurrency prevent overlapping deploys.
    3. Extend workflow contract tests for the schedule trigger, immutable-SHA flow, no-branch
       mutation, credential gates, and deployed timestamp evidence.
  Acceptance: a scheduled run changes no branch, deploys from one recorded default-branch
    SHA, and the live dashboard shows newer source timestamps; absent-secret checkout green
  Downstream: 11.6

[11.6] Trend-discovery routine (news lens for the instance)
  Effort: M | Model: Opus | Depends: 11.1; 10.2b enriches, not required
  Est: AI 2h + 0.5h review | Human 0.25h (approve the first proposal PR)
  Steps:
    1. Add a /sekai-discover-trends skill plus a framework template for instance-owned
       knowledge/_SOURCES.md. The leading underscore keeps the source manifest out of the
       article scanners. No configured sources means a named no-op, never invented sources.
    2. Add a weekly cloud Routine template that reads configured local news, event, and
       community sources plus analytics signals when present. It must cite every proposal's
       source and deduplicate against existing articles and INBOX entries.
    3. Open a PR adding sourced article and snippet candidates to knowledge/INBOX.md.
       Proposals only: never write an article and never push the default branch.
  Acceptance: a live run yields at least three sourced, non-duplicate proposals in one
    human-reviewed INBOX PR; zero direct article commits; the absent-source fixture no-ops
  Downstream: 11.8 feed, 11.9

[11.7] MOVED to 12.2 by the 2026-08-18 amendment (D3). No first-instance platform adapter
  or enabled social account exists; the named Phase 6 trigger is unsatisfied, not Phase 8.

[11.8] Rewrite routine (KB freshness)
  Effort: M | Model: Opus | Depends: 11.1, 11.3
  Est: AI 2h + 0.5h review | Human 0.25h (merge the first rewrite PR)
  Steps:
    1. Add a scheduled cloud Routine template that selects one open content-maintenance
       issue, chooses the lowest-health or stalest affected article, and invokes
       /sekai-write through the canonical pipeline.
    2. Open a human-merge content PR, link the maintenance issue, report the before/after
       health score, and wait for the 11.3 content-review routine. Never merge or close the
       issue before the human-merged PR proves the fix.
  Acceptance: a live run produces one rewrite PR whose article-health score exceeds the
    prior score; the PR carries the automated content review; the default branch changed
    only through the human merge
  Downstream: 11.9

[11.9] Phase 11 exit gate: ship the tag, adopt it in the instance, run automation live
  Effort: S | Model: Opus | Depends: 11.1, 11.3, 11.5, 11.6, 11.8
  Est: AI 0.5h + 0.25h review | Human 0.5h (native routine registration and first rewrite
    merge approval)
  Execution repo: the instance (every commit); the tag is cut in sekai-kb at verify of the
    last framework task.
  Steps:
    1. Cut the sekai-kb release covering the Phase 11 framework tasks, with an upgrade note
       for AUTOMATION.md, new skills/source template, and the analytics schedule opt-in.
    2. Adopt it with /sekai-upgrade (real merge commit, instance-owned files untouched,
       instance CI green, FRAMEWORK-VERSION bumped after verification).
    3. Configure only the repositories, connectors, environment values, and triggers named
       by AUTOMATION.md. Register the content review, maintenance, trend, and rewrite native
       Routines; enable the GitHub Actions analytics schedule path.
    4. Run at least two native Routines for one week. Inspect transcripts and named external
       effects, not green badges alone. Verify every repository change arrived through a PR
       and git history contains zero routine direct-push commits to the default branch.
  Acceptance: two native Routines have run for at least one week with their named effects;
    scheduled analytics refresh is proven on the live dashboard; every repository change
    shipped through a PR; zero direct pushes to main; maintainer phase confirm
  Downstream: Phase 12 entry when its independent gates are satisfied

**Phase 12: Gated integrations - DEFERRED, unscheduled**

**Created by the 2026-08-18 amendment; ADR 013.** This phase has no Phase 8 dependency.
It waits on its own gates: explicit human approval in feedback-triage runs, and a real
enabled social account with a reviewed platform adapter.

```
[12.1] Feedback triage Routine with exact-plan human approval
  Effort: M | Model: Opus | Depends: 11.1, 6.1b; not Phase 8
  Est: AI 3h + 0.75h review | Human 0.25h (approve the first live plan)
  Decision: native Routines have no approval prompt, so unattended execution cannot satisfy
    /sekai-triage-feedback's explicit approval contract. The scheduled run produces the
    plan and stops; the maintainer approves in that same run session (ADR 013).
  Steps:
    1. Add the daily native Routine template with only the instance repository, Cloudflare
       environment values needed by Wrangler, and GitHub access needed by the existing
       skill. Contact data remains unread and unprinted.
    2. Invoke /sekai-triage-feedback --dry-run. If zero rows exist, exit successfully. If a
       plan exists, stop after displaying it and require the maintainer to open that run and
       explicitly approve the exact plan in the same session.
    3. After approval, invoke live mode, preserve the skill's re-read and byte-identical plan
       check, execute one row at a time, and verify every D1 result. A saved prompt, trigger,
       silence, or standing approval is rejected.
    4. Add network-free contract tests proving dry-run writes nothing, the first session turn
       stops before writes, changed inputs invalidate approval, and contact never appears.
  Acceptance: a seeded D1 row produces a complete no-write plan automatically; explicit
    approval in that run leads to exactly one GitHub issue/comment and the verified D1 state;
    no approval produces no GitHub or D1 write
  Downstream: 12.3

[12.2] Live social adapter + scheduled approved-snippet publishing
  Effort: M | Model: Opus | Depends: 11.1, 6.2 + a real instance account exists and
    features.social is enabled; not Phase 8
  Est: AI 2.5h + 0.5h review | Human 0.5h (account/API setup and first post verification)
  Decision: the real account selects one platform and its current API. No adapter is built
    before that trigger. Human approval remains the pending-to-approved queue edit.
  Steps:
    1. Revalidate the selected platform's API, auth, scopes, rate limits, idempotency, and
       content limits. Implement one reviewed adapter beside manual-adapter.mjs; credentials
       come only from the native Routine environment.
    2. Use the queue entry id as the platform idempotency key, or implement an equivalent
       remote lookup that returns the original post URL on retry. A failed PR or rerun must
       never duplicate an already-live post.
    3. Add a scheduled native Routine template that invokes npm run snippet:publish only for
       approved entries, opens a PR recording posted + URL, and leaves pending, rejected, and
       posted entries untouched. Content is never drafted or approved by this routine.
    4. Add fixture tests for auth failure, rate limit, remote success + local PR failure,
       retry reconciliation, over-length refusal, and pending-entry non-reachability.
  Acceptance: an approved snippet posts exactly once to the live account and its URL reaches
    the queue through a PR; rerunning after a planted local failure records the same URL and
    creates no second post; pending/unapproved entries never reach the adapter
  Downstream: 12.3

[12.3] Phase 12 exit gate: ship the tag, adopt it in the instance, prove both integrations
  Effort: S | Model: Opus | Depends: 12.1, 12.2
  Est: AI 0.5h + 0.25h review | Human 0.5h (feedback approval and live social post)
  Execution repo: the instance (every commit); the tag is cut in sekai-kb at verify of the
    last framework task.
  Steps:
    1. Cut the sekai-kb release covering 12.1-12.2, with upgrade notes for the feedback
       Routine environment and selected social adapter credentials.
    2. Adopt it with /sekai-upgrade (real merge commit, instance-owned files untouched,
       instance CI green, FRAMEWORK-VERSION bumped after verification).
    3. Register both native Routines with only their named access. Approve one feedback plan
       in its run session and verify GitHub + D1. Approve one snippet by hand, let the social
       Routine post it, merge its queue-update PR, and verify the remote URL.
  Acceptance: feedback approval and writes match the exact plan; the approved snippet exists
    once remotely and once in the merged queue record; no direct push to main; no Phase 8 or
    semiont/ input; maintainer phase confirm
  Downstream: none - this closes the roadmap
