# AGENTS.md

Instructions for AI agent CLIs (codex-cli, and any tool that reads this file).

**Read [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) — it is the boot document for this repository,
regardless of which agent CLI you are running.** Everything there applies to you:
where things live, how the site builds, the iron rules (SSOT, genericity +
English-only, framework vs instance), the language support boundary, and the
semiont probe rule.

Beyond that, the working set for any agent session:

- **Writing or editing content:** follow
  [`docs/playbook/ARTICLE-PLAYBOOK.md`](./docs/playbook/ARTICLE-PLAYBOOK.md) and
  the stage sequence in
  [`docs/playbook/REWRITE-PIPELINE.md`](./docs/playbook/REWRITE-PIPELINE.md).
  Edit only `knowledge/` — never the derived `src/content/`.
- **Verifying claims:** [`docs/playbook/FACTCHECK-PIPELINE.md`](./docs/playbook/FACTCHECK-PIPELINE.md).
  Never fabricate a fact, a source, or a quote.
- **Build, toolchain, deploy commands:** [`docs/runbook/DEPLOY.md`](./docs/runbook/DEPLOY.md).
  Python tooling always runs through `uv` (`uv sync`, `uv run`); never `pip`.
- **Before committing:** `npm run test`, the relevant
  `npm run article-health -- <file> --profile=...` gate, and `npm run build`
  must pass. The pre-commit hook enforces a subset; don't rely on it as the
  first check.
