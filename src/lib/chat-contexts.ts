/**
 * chat-contexts.ts — the `knowledge/chat/_contexts.md` manifest reader.
 *
 * A context is a physical place a reader can be standing in when they scan a code:
 * a trailhead, a pier, a museum room. It carries the greeting `/chat?ctx=<slug>`
 * opens with, and an optional retrieval hint that biases the first question toward
 * the articles about that spot. Greetings and location labels are prose about a
 * place, which is content, so the whole list lives in `knowledge/` and never in
 * `place.config.ts` or `src/`.
 *
 * The file is named `_contexts.md` and the leading underscore is load-bearing: it
 * is what makes the file invisible to the three scanners that walk `knowledge/`
 * looking for articles —
 *
 *   - scripts/core/test-frontmatter.mjs    discovers categories from the filesystem,
 *                                          then filters `!f.startsWith('_')`
 *   - scripts/tools/article-health.py      globs `*.md`, skipping `startswith("_")`
 *   - scripts/core/build-content-dates.mjs returns null for `file.startsWith('_')`
 *
 * Rename it without that prefix and the article pipeline starts treating this list
 * of greetings as an article with no title, description, or category.
 *
 * The whole manifest is optional, and so is every consumer's route set. Every read
 * path degrades to an empty or reduced result instead of throwing: `readFileSync`
 * inside `try/catch`, never `await import()` — Rollup resolves a literal import
 * specifier before any catch handler runs, so a try/catch around a dynamic import
 * of a missing file is dead code
 * (`.agent-toolkit/rules/optional-build-time-json-readfilesync.md`).
 *
 * This file lives under src/, which both machine gates scan: its source is pure
 * ASCII and carries no place-specific string. Every place-bearing value comes from
 * the manifest it reads.
