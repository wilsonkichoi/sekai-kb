# /factcheck — Fact-check an article (thin shell)

> **Intentionally thin.** Every phase, gate, and method lives in the pipeline
> canon. This skill loads context and runs it — it does not restate or fork
> pipeline content (drift = decay). Ground truth for place facts is `knowledge/`.

## 1. Load context

Read `place.config.ts` for `place.name`, then read
`docs/playbook/FACTCHECK-PIPELINE.md` in full (no `limit` / `offset`). The
editorial standard it protects lives in `docs/playbook/ARTICLE-PLAYBOOK.md` §4.6
(citations) and §4.8 (quote fidelity).

## 2. Execute the pipeline

Follow FACTCHECK-PIPELINE Phases 1–6 as written. Mode is set by context:

- **Quick** — during a rewrite (REWRITE-PIPELINE Stage 3) or spot-checking a PR.
- **Full** — a standalone audit, a reader challenge, or a periodic patrol.

## 3. Report

Report findings per Phase 6 triage (PASS / SOFT-FIX / HARD-FIX / DEAD-LINK). Fix
every HARD-FIX and DEAD-LINK in `knowledge/` (the SSOT) and `npm run sync` before
anything ships.
