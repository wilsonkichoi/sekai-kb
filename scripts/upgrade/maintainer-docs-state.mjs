//   node scripts/upgrade/maintainer-docs-state.mjs paths     [--repo <dir>] [--from-tag <tag>]
//
// Why this exists: `.gitattributes merge=ours` protects the CONTENT of a path that
// exists on both merge sides. It does not preserve an intentionally ABSENT path.
// The framework's own maintainer documents are removed by `npm run init`, so an
// adopted instance has none of them — git therefore applies no merge driver there
// and re-adds the framework's copies on every tag merge that touched them (a
// modify/delete conflict on shared history, a theirs-only addition on an
// unrelated-history first merge). This is the dev-plugin failure of ADR 006's
// addendum in a second location, and `dev-plugin-state.mjs` is its sibling.
//
// The path set is NEVER hardcoded here. It is derived at runtime from the init
// wizard's exported MAINTAINER_DOCS — the same single source the CI gate
// `scripts/ci/check-framework-docs.mjs` derives from, which imports the parser
// below and asserts both agree. A hardcoded copy in the upgrade path would drift
// from the strip it exists to preserve.
//
// `--from-tag <tag>` moves only the DERIVATION to that tag, reading the wizard with
// `git show <tag>:scripts/init/writer.mjs`; path PRESENCE is still read from the
// pre-merge working tree, which is the only place that records what the instance
// owns. It exists for the first upgrade to a release that introduces the strip
// list: the helper is bootstrapped out of that tag, but the working tree's wizard
// still predates the export, so deriving from the working tree exits 3 and the
// classification the whole pass depends on cannot be produced at all. Later
// upgrades may pass it or not — after the first merge both sources agree, because
// the wizard is framework-owned.
//
// Classification is PER PATH, not whole-set (ADR 008 addendum (a)): these paths
// carry no activation signal and are mutually independent, so an instance may
// legitimately own some and not others. A partial set is a normal state, never a
// stop.
//
//   owned    = present before the merge -> never deleted; a change the merge made is
//              RESTORED where the instance marked the path `merge=ours`, and stops
//              the upgrade where it did not
//   stripped = absent  before the merge -> whatever the merge introduced is removed
//
// The restore exists because `merge=ours` names a driver git runs only on a
// three-way CONTENT merge: an instance whose copy still equals the merge base has
// `ours == base`, so git resolves to theirs and the attribute never fires. That is
// a property of every `merge=ours` path, not of one file — `package-state.mjs`
// applies the same capture-and-restore to `FRAMEWORK-VERSION`, and this helper
// applies it to the maintainer-doc tree.
//
// `classify` runs in preflight, BEFORE the merge, on a clean working tree, and
// writes its answer into the git directory (never the working tree). `reconcile`
// reads that answer immediately AFTER the merge command, whether the merge stopped
// on conflicts or completed on its own — after the merge the tree no longer shows
// what the instance owned.
//
// Exit codes: 0 = ok, 1 = reconcile failed / postcondition violated,
// 2 = usage error, 3 = the maintainer-doc contract could not be derived.
