# check-sounds-selftest.sh -- non-vacuity proof for the soundscape manifest
# gate (scripts/ci/check-sounds.mjs).
#
# A guard that only ever asserts the green path proves nothing. This test plants
# each of the gate's failing classes into a temp copy and requires the gate
# to FAIL each time, then asserts the gate PASSES on the shipped tree, and
# asserts the orphan case exits zero while naming the orphan on stdout.
#
#   1. MISSING FIELD  -- a recording with a required field removed.
#   2. UNRESOLVED FILE -- a `file` whose mp3 does not exist under public/.
#   3. PATH ESCAPE    -- a `file` containing a `..` segment.
#   4. DUPLICATE ID   -- two categories sharing the same `id`.
#   5. ORPHAN (pass)  -- an mp3 under public/media/sounds/ unreferenced; gate
#                        must exit 0 but name the orphan on stdout.
#
# Classes 6-9 are the published-metadata class. The gate's rule is that a
# published recording carries NO metadata tag of any kind, so proving it on one
# tag form would leave the other forms as an untested claim; each container an
# mp3 can carry a tag in gets its own planted case, and the wrong-container case
# covers a recording renamed to .mp3 rather than converted.
#
#   6. ID3v2 TAG      -- the form every observed phone leak arrives in.
#   7. ID3v1 TAG      -- a trailing 128-byte TAG block.
#   8. APE TAG        -- an APETAGEX footer.
#   9. WRONG CONTAINER -- bytes that are not an MPEG audio stream at all.
#
# Every planted tag is fabricated in this script; no real recording and no real
# coordinate is ever committed as a fixture.
#
# Portable to macOS bash 3.2 and CI bash 5 (no mapfile; CDPATH unset). This
# script's source is pure ASCII and carries no denylisted place term.
