# check-scan-root-docs-selftest.sh -- non-vacuity proof for the scan-root docs
# gate (scripts/ci/check-scan-root-docs.mjs).
#
# A guard that only ever asserts the green path proves nothing: it would pass
# just as happily with an empty registry or an unreachable comparison. This test
# mutates the repository three ways and requires the guard to FAIL each time,
# then restores every file it touched:
#
#   1. DOC drift    -- drop a root from a documented list. The statement no
#                      longer enumerates its gate's roots.
#   2. SCRIPT drift -- add a root to check-english-only.mjs's SCAN_ROOTS. Every
#                      English-only statement is now short one root, which is the
#                      direction that actually happens (a new tree is added and
#                      the prose is not updated).
#   3. ANCHOR loss  -- reword a registered statement so its anchor no longer
#                      matches. An unfindable statement must fail, never pass
#                      silently, because that is how a stale one hides.
#
# Between mutations the guard must pass on the restored tree, so a mutation that
# fails to apply cannot masquerade as a caught regression.
#
# Portable to macOS bash 3.2 and CI bash 5 (no mapfile; CDPATH unset; sed writes
# through a temp file rather than using the non-portable -i). This script's own
# source is pure ASCII and carries no denylisted place term -- it lives under
# scripts/, which both gates scan.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/ci/check-scan-root-docs-selftest.sh   (run from anywhere;
# exit 1 when the guard fails to catch a planted drift, exit 0 when it catches
# all three)
