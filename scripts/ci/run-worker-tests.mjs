// run-worker-tests.mjs -- the `npm run test:workers` entry point.
//
// Runs every Cloudflare Worker unit suite (workers/**/*.test.mjs) under the
// node:test runner. Discovery is by walking the tree, so a worker added in a later
// phase is gated the moment its first *.test.mjs lands -- no edit here and none in
// the CI workflow.
//
// Why this exists instead of `node --test <path>` in package.json: neither native
// form is safe as a CI gate.
//
//   - `node --test workers/` resolves the directory as a module and fails with
//     "Cannot find module" (verified on Node 22 and 24). Loud, but broken.
//   - `node --test "workers/**/*.test.mjs"` runs correctly, but a glob that matches
//     NOTHING exits 0. A refactor that moves or renames the suites would leave a
//     green `test` job running zero tests, which is the exact failure the DoD-guard
//     doctrine exists to stop: a guard nothing forces you to run is not a guard.
//
// So: zero discovered files in a workers/ tree that exists is a hard failure. An
// absent workers/ tree is a skip, matching the scan-root convention of the
// genericity gates -- an adopter who deletes a worker they do not use keeps a green
// CI, while anyone who keeps the tree cannot lose its coverage silently.
//
// This file lives under scripts/, which both machine gates scan: its source is pure
// ASCII and carries no denylisted place term.
//
// Usage: node scripts/ci/run-worker-tests.mjs   (run from anywhere)
