# Scan scope: src/, scripts/, tests/, and .claude/skills/ (test fixtures are

# task 5.6). place.config.ts (repo root), knowledge/, public/media/, and docs/
# hold place identity legitimately and are outside the scan roots by
# construction; the denylist file itself is inside scripts/ and is excluded
# explicitly (it necessarily contains the forbidden terms).

# Build the file list with `find` (prune dirs, then grep the survivors), rather
# than `grep -r --exclude-dir`. `--exclude-dir` matches on the directory BASENAME
# on both GNU and BSD grep, so the derived projection `public/kb/` and the
# `.claude/skills/kb/` router share the name `kb` and would be excluded together
# — silently exempting the router from the gate (LB-30 review blocker). The two
# exclusion classes are therefore matched differently:
#  - Vendor/tool caches (node_modules, .git, dist, .astro, .venv, __pycache__):
#    pruned by basename — no legitimate framework dir ever carries these names,
#    anywhere in the tree. .git is critical in template mode — commit messages
#    carry the pre-cut place name.
#  - The derived, gitignored projections of knowledge/ (src/content via sync.sh,
#    src/data via prebuild JSON, public/kb via build-kb-index): pruned by PATH,
#    so a same-basename dir elsewhere (the .claude/skills/kb router) is still
#    scanned.
#  - The denylist files (they necessarily contain the forbidden terms) and the
#    template marker are dropped by filename.
# grep -I skips binary files. -print0/xargs -0 handle any spaces in paths.
