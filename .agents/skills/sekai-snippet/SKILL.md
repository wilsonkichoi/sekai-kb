  Draft a short-form social post from a knowledge/ article and queue it for human
  approval. Reads exactly one article, writes a platform-neutral draft carrying no
  claim that article does not make, and appends it to knowledge/SNIPPET-INBOX.md
  with status pending. Never approves, never publishes, never edits the article.

# /sekai-snippet - Queue a short-form draft

> Grounding is the whole job. A snippet is read by people who have not read the
> article, so a claim invented here is a claim the knowledge base never made and
> cannot defend. `docs/playbook/FACTCHECK-PIPELINE.md` is the standing discipline;
> this skill applies it to a 280-character surface.

## Arguments

`/sekai-snippet <article>` where `<article>` is either a path
(`knowledge/{Category}/{slug}.md`) or a slug this skill resolves. With no
argument, ask which article; never pick one yourself.

Reject unknown arguments. This skill takes no flags: there is no dry-run mode
because it performs no publish and no destructive write, and no approval flag
because approval is a human edit to the queue file and nothing else.

## 1. Resolve exactly one article

Resolve the argument to one existing file under `knowledge/{Category}/`:

```bash
ls knowledge/*/<slug>.md
```

Stop and ask if it resolves to zero or to more than one. A leading-underscore
file (`_*.md`) is a section hub, not an article; refuse it. Never draft from
`src/content/`, which is a derived projection, and never from a root-level
workflow file.

Read the whole article. Read the whole article before writing anything, not a
skim of the opening: the strongest snippet is usually a specific fact from the
middle, and you cannot tell which claims are load-bearing from the lead alone.

## 2. Write the draft

The draft is **derived reporting, not marketing**. Constraints, all binding:

- **Every factual claim appears in the article.** Dates, numbers, names, and
  causal statements are copied or faithfully compressed, never inferred, rounded
  into vagueness, or embellished. If a claim needs a qualifier the article gives
  it ("as of 2019", "the town's own estimate"), the qualifier comes along.
- **No claim the article does not make.** Not from your own knowledge, not from
  the wider web, not from the place's other articles. If the article is thin, the
  snippet is short; that is the correct outcome, not a problem to write around.
- **Platform-neutral text.** No hashtags, no @-handles, no platform-specific
  affordances, no "link in bio". One URL at most, the article's own, and only if
  `place.domain` is set in `place.config.ts`.
- **At most 280 Unicode code points**, the tightest mainstream short-form limit,
  so the text pastes anywhere. Over that, the runner refuses the entry.
- **The house voice**, per `docs/playbook/ARTICLE-PLAYBOOK.md`: concrete, specific,
  no hype adjectives, no rhetorical questions, no "did you know".

Lead with the most specific true thing in the article -- a named person, a dated
event, a number -- rather than a summary of what the article covers.

## 3. Verify the draft against the article

Before writing anything to disk, list every claim in the draft and name the line
or passage of the article that supports it. A claim you cannot point at is
removed, not softened. Show this mapping to the user with the draft.

Then count the characters exactly. Code points, not bytes and not UTF-16 units:

```bash
node -e 'process.stdout.write(String([...require("node:fs").readFileSync(0,"utf8")].length))' < <draft-file>
```

## 4. Append the queue entry

Create `knowledge/SNIPPET-INBOX.md` if it is absent -- a freshly adopted instance
has no queue until the first snippet, because the init wizard reseeds `knowledge/`
with category folders and `INBOX.md` only. Copy the header from the framework's
own copy of the file, including its lifecycle table and format example, so the
human reading it later has the same instructions.

Append one entry at the end of the file, under its `## Entries` heading:

```
## snippet-<YYYY-MM-DD>-<article-slug>

- slug: <Category>/<article-slug>
- created: <YYYY-MM-DD>
- chars: <count from step 3>
- status: pending
- url:
```

followed by a blank line and the post text in a fenced ```text block.

Rules the runner enforces, so get them right here:

- The id must be unique in the file. A second snippet from the same article on the
  same day takes a `-2`, `-3`, ... suffix.
- `created` is today's date, resolved from the system, never guessed.
- `chars` must equal the code-point count of the post text. A mismatch fails the
  whole queue file, not just this entry.
- `status` is always `pending` on append. **Never write `approved`.** Approval is
  the human's edit; a skill that grants it removes the only gate in the pipeline.
- `url` is left empty.

Append only. Never edit, reorder, or delete an existing entry, whatever its
status -- including a `rejected` one, which is a record of a decision.

## 5. Report and stop

Print the draft, its character count, the claim-to-article mapping from step 3,
and the entry id. Then tell the user exactly what happens next:

1. Read the entry in `knowledge/SNIPPET-INBOX.md` against its source article.
2. Edit `status: pending` to `status: approved` by hand.
3. Run `npm run snippet:publish`.

Do not run the publisher, do not offer to run it, and do not commit the queue
file on the user's behalf. This skill's output is one `pending` entry and nothing
else.
