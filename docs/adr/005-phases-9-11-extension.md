# ADR 005: Phases 9-11 extension — MCP delivery, analytics perception, autonomous routines

**Status:** Accepted (2026-07-07, Wilson session decision)
**Deciders:** Wilson Choi, with Fable 5 as architect

## Context

Wilson audited roadmap coverage of three goal areas: routine pipelines (KB maintenance,
semantic embedding/indexing, PR review, feedback triage, trend discovery, analytics data
refresh, social media), the RAG chatbot, and MCP server / alternative knowledge delivery.
The RAG chatbot (§E 7.2a-c) and the `/kb/` + llms.txt lazy-loading protocol (§E 1.3) are
covered. The MCP endpoint had only a §F named trigger ("port when 7.2c ships") with no
phase; the routines had only the Phase-8 ROUTINE-organ *scaffold* — §F disposes taiwan-md's
16 routines as "delete-now as implementation, concept returns as per-routine opt-ins" —
with zero routines actually scheduled, and the analytics fetchers parked on a
"port-on-trigger: accounts exist" clause nothing was set to fire. Wilson directed that
these be scheduled, not tabled.

## Decision

Extend the operative docs with **Phases 9 (MCP + AI delivery), 10 (analytics perception),
and 11 (autonomous routines)**. Sub-decisions:

1. **Governance.** `.fable/STRATEGIC-DIRECTION.md` stays frozen and unedited; the
   extension lives in `docs/ROADMAP.md` (milestone rows + an "Extension task blocks"
   appendix in §E's block format, from which `/dev:plan` converts packets exactly as it
   does from §E) and `docs/SPEC.md`/`docs/PRD.md`. This follows the SPEC `links`
   precedent for intentional, tracked divergence: an extension, not a conflict.
2. **Scheduler substrate: hybrid.** Deterministic pipelines (embeddings/index refresh,
   analytics fetch) run as GitHub Actions cron/push-triggers — free, machine-independent,
   adopter-portable. AI routines (maintainer/PR review, feedback triage, trend discovery,
   social publish, rewrite) run as Claude Code native scheduled tasks on Wilson's machine
   (the proven taiwan-md pattern). Each routine declares its substrate in ROUTINE.md.
3. **Ship mode: PRs, auto-merge for data.** Every routine ships via a PR behind CI;
   data-only PRs (analytics JSON, vectors) carry auto-merge-on-green, content PRs wait
   for human merge. taiwan-md's direct-push-to-main routine model is rejected — the
   dev-plugin iron rule (no work done outside a verified merge) applies to automation.
4. **Analytics: full stack.** GA4 + Google Search Console + Cloudflare Web Analytics
   behind `features.analytics`; Search Console is the only source of query-level SEO data,
   which the trend-discovery routine consumes.
5. **Release-train execution.** Phases 9-11 run post-cut, so every code task executes in
   `sekai-kb`; each phase ships as a tagged release and LB adopts it via `/upgrade`
   (ADR 004) — the pull is part of each phase's exit gate. Task 9.3 writes
   `docs/runbook/UPGRADE.md`, the adopter-facing upgrade playbook, from the first real
   feature-release upgrade (Phase 9 itself, whose `features.mcp` is the first post-cut
   config-schema addition). **Absent-safe rule:** every new `place.config` key defaults
   to feature-off when missing, so instances upgrade without config surgery.
6. **Model policy:** all Phase 9-11 execution uses Opus (Wilson, 2026-07-07); reviews
   follow `.claude/dev.md` defaults.

**Technical verification (2026-07):** stateless remote MCP servers (Streamable HTTP, no
Durable Objects) run on the Workers free tier via the `createMcpHandler` pattern —
Cloudflare docs: <https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/model-context-protocol/guides/remote-mcp-server/>,
<https://blog.cloudflare.com/remote-model-context-protocol-servers-mcp/>. Fits the
no-paid-services constraint; McpAgent/Durable Objects documented as the scale-up path.

## Consequences

- Every §F "port-on-named-trigger" item in scope now has a scheduled home: MCP → 9.1,
  analytics fetchers → 10.2, embeddings refresh → 11.2, per-routine opt-ins → 11.3-11.8.
- Grand totals grow by AI ≈ 26.75h | Human ≈ 2.5h (ROADMAP totals updated).
- The PRD "no paid services" non-goal is clarified to "no paid hosting/infra services";
  routine AI compute rides Wilson's existing Claude subscription/API budget.
- LB operations gain a machine dependency for claude-cron routines (Wilson's always-on
  machine); the GH-Actions substrate keeps the deterministic half portable for adopters,
  and any adopter can run zero routines (organ off = nothing fires).
- `.claude/dev.md` milestones span "Phase 0" … "Phase 11"; `review_action_installed`
  flips at 11.3.
